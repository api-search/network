description: >-
  AI can do extraordinary things, but its still too hard to use. We don't
  believe AI is inherently hard. We just don't have the right tools and
  abstractions yet. Were building tools so all software engineers can use AI as
  if it were normal software. You should be able to import an image generator
  the same way you import an npm package. You should be able to customize a
  model as easily as you can fork something on GitHub.
