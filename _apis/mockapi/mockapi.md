  MockAPI is a powerful tool for developers to create custom APIs for testing
  and prototyping web applications. With MockAPI, users can easily define
  endpoints, response data, headers, and status codes to simulate real-world API
  behavior. This allows developers to quickly and accurately mimic the
  functionality of external APIs without the need for a live server or internet
  connection. Additionally, MockAPI provides a user-friendly interface for
  managing and visualizing API endpoints, making it easy to debug and
  troubleshoot API calls. Overall, MockAPI is a valuable resource for
  streamlining the development process and ensuring that web applications are
  robust and reliable.
