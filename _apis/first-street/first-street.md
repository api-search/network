description: "First Street models use validated and proven methodologies to ensure model accuracy. We measure and predict the impact of a peril based on the underlying physics of how an actual event would transpire. Whether that is a fluid dynamics equation we run or individual pyrome calibrations, our team and partners build off of decades of peer-reviewed research while incorporating the latest technology advancements.\L\LThis is the only way to create models that can be accurately applied at a property level and can be confidently adjusted into the future under new, unobserved climate scenarios."
