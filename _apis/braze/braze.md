description: >-
  The Braze and Radar integration allows you to access sophisticated
  location-based campaign triggers and user profile enrichment with rich,
  first-party location data. When Radar geofence or trip tracking events are
  generated, custom events and user attributes are sent to Braze in real-time.
  These events and attributes can then be used to trigger location-based
  campaigns, power last-mile pickup and delivery operations, monitor fleet and
  shipping logistics, or build user segments based on location patterns.
