  The Shutterstock OAuth API is a tool that allows developers to securely access
  Shutterstock's database of images, videos, and music through a standardized
  authentication protocol. By integrating OAuth into their applications,
  developers can streamline the process of obtaining user authorization to
  access their Shutterstock account, allowing for seamless interactions with the
  platform. This authentication method ensures that user credentials are not
  compromised during the authentication process, making it a reliable and secure
  way for developers to access Shutterstock's vast collection of media assets.
