  The Shutterstock CV API is a powerful tool that allows developers to access
  Shutterstock's vast library of images and videos using advanced image
  recognition technology. This API can analyze the contents of an image or video
  and provide detailed metadata, such as keywords, categories, and concepts.
  With this information, developers can easily search for and retrieve relevant
  media content from Shutterstock's extensive collection, making it easier to
  find the perfect assets for their projects. Additionally, the CV API offers
  functionality for automatically tagging and organizing media files,
  streamlining the content creation process and enhancing the overall user
  experience.
