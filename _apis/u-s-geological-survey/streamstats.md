  StreamStats provides access to spatial analytical tools that are useful for
  water-resources planning and management, and for engineering and design
  purposes. The map-based user interface can be used to delineate drainage
  areas, get basin characteristics and estimates of flow statistics, and more.
  Available information varies from state to state.
