  The Fantasy Sports APIs provide URIs used to access fantasy sports data.
  Currently the APIs support retrieval of Fantasy Football, Baseball,
  Basketball, and Hockey data including game, league, team, and player
  information. The APIs are based on a RESTful model. Therefore, resources like
  game, league, team, player etc. and collections like games, leagues, teams,
  players form the building blocks for these APIs. Each resource is identified
  by a resource ID, and a collection is identified by its scope, specified in
  the URI.
