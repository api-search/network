  The Standard Energy Efficiency Data Platform (SEED) Platform is an open-source
  software application designed to manage building performance data (such as
  required by a benchmarking ordinance) which can be costly and time consuming
  for states, local governments and other organizations. SEED helps users
  combine data from multiple sources, clean and validate it, and generate
  queries and reports.
