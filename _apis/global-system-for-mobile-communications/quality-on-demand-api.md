  Quality on Demand API offers the application developer the capability to
  request stable latency (reduced jitter) or minimum throughput for specified
  application data flows between application clients (within a user device) and
  Application Servers (backend services). The developer has a pre-defined set of
  Quality of Service (QoS) profiles which they could choose from depending on
  their latency or throughput requirements.
