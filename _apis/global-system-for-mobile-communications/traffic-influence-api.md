  The Traffic Influence API provides the capability to establish the optimal
  routing, in terms of latency, in a specific geographical area, between the
  user device, e.g. the users smartphone, and the optimal Edge Application
  Server (EAS) instance nearby. If the user device is detected by the developer
  to have moved into a different geographical location, the Traffic Influence
  API can be invoked again to get the optimal routing in the new location.
