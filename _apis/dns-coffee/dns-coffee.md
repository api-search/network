  DNS Coffee collects, analyzes, and archives changes to root zone files
  provided by various top-level domains (TLDs), offering one of the most
  comprehensive views of the current state of the Domain Name System (DNS). By
  continuously tracking these changes, DNS Coffee uncovers valuable trends over
  time, making it a powerful resource for analysis and research. What began in
  2011 with just 4 zones has grown into a robust platform that now processes
  data from over 1,200 zones daily.
