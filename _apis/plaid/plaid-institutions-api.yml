description: >-
  Institutions endpoints support querying all institutions, as well as looking
  up a single institution to retrieve up-to-date information about its health
  status and capabilities. This can be useful for apps whose business logic may
  depend on institution capabilities, such as Payment Initiation. API-provided
  institution health data can also be used for in-app UIs.
