  Plaid Institutions API is a tool designed to make it easier for developers to
  integrate financial institutions into their applications. By using this API,
  developers can access data from thousands of financial institutions, allowing
  users to securely connect their accounts, view balances and transaction
  history, and perform other financial tasks within the app. This API simplifies
  the process of working with multiple financial institutions, enabling
  developers to create more comprehensive and user-friendly financial
  applications. Additionally, Plaid Institutions API offers robust security
  measures to protect users' sensitive financial information, ensuring peace of
  mind for both developers and users.
