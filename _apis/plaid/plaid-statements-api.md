  Plaid Statements API allows developers to access and retrieve bank statement
  data from their users' bank accounts. This data includes information such as
  transaction history, account balances, and pending transactions. By
  integrating with the Plaid Statements API, developers can offer their users a
  comprehensive and real-time view of their financial transactions, making it
  easier for them to track their spending, budget effectively, and manage their
  money more efficiently. Additionally, Plaid's robust security measures ensure
  that sensitive financial information is securely transmitted and protected.
