description: >-
  The Plaid Signal API is a powerful tool that allows developers to receive
  real-time notifications and alerts about their users' financial activities. By
  integrating this API into their applications, developers can stay informed
  about important events such as large transactions, account balance changes,
  and potential fraudulent activity. This level of visibility enables developers
  to provide better and more secure user experiences, ultimately leading to
  increased trust and satisfaction among their customers. With the Plaid Signal
  API, developers can take proactive measures to protect their users' financial
  well-being and ensure that their applications remain secure and reliable.
