description: >-
  The Plaid Liabilities API is a financial tool that allows developers to access
  detailed information about a user's liabilities, such as credit card balances,
  loans, and other debts. By connecting with a user's financial accounts, the
  API can provide real-time updates on the status of their liabilities,
  including current balances, due dates, interest rates, and minimum payments.
  This information can help users better manage their debts and make more
  informed financial decisions. Additionally, developers can use the API to
  create innovative financial products and services that help users pay down
  their debts and improve their overall financial health.
