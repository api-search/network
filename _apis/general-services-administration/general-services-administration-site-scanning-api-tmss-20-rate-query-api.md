  This document provides detailed technical information about the Rate query API
  offered by TMSS 2.0 at the request of Federal Civilian Agencies. These
  services make use of industry standard methods for API authentication and
  connectivity, which should make it easier and faster for developers to
  interface Federal agency with TMSS 2.0. This API can be used to retrieve
  shipment cost for a regular Household Goods (HHG) shipment or for an Extended
  Storage (EXSTG) shipment.
