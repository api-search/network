  The analytics data recorded provide a window into how people are interacting
  with the government online. The data come from a unified Google Analytics
  account for U.S. federal government agencies known as the Digital Analytics
  Program (DAP). This program helps government agencies understand how people
  find, access, and use government services online. The program does not track
  individuals and anonymizes the IP addresses of visitors.
