  The data.gov catalog is powered by CKAN, a powerful open source data platform
  that includes a robust API. Please be aware that data.gov and the data.gov
  CKAN API only contain metadata about datasets. This metadata includes URLs and
  descriptions of datasets, but it does not include the actual data within each
  dataset.
