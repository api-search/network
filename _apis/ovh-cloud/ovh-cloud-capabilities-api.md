  The OVH Cloud Capabilities API is a powerful tool that allows users to access
  and manage resources within the OVH cloud infrastructure. With this API, users
  can programmatically interact with virtual machines, storage, networking, and
  other services offered by OVH. It enables automation of tasks such as
  provisioning and configuring cloud resources, monitoring usage and

  flexible and efficient way to integrate OVH cloud capabilities into custom
  applications and workflows, making it easier for users to leverage the full
  potential of their cloud resources.
