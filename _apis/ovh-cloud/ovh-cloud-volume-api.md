  The OVH Cloud Volume API is a tool that allows users to easily manage and
  provision additional storage volumes for their OVH cloud infrastructure. With
  this API, users can create, delete, resize, snapshot, and attach additional
  storage volumes to their instances with just a few simple commands. This
  streamlines the process of managing storage resources and allows users to
  quickly and efficiently scale their storage capacity as needed. The API
  provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with storage volumes,
  making it easy for users to customize their storage configurations to meet
  their specific needs.
