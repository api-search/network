  The OVH Cloud Image API is a service provided by OVH, a leading cloud
  provider, that allows users to manage and interact with their cloud images.
  Cloud images are pre-configured virtual machine disks that can be used to
  quickly and easily deploy and clone virtual machines in the cloud. The OVH
  Cloud Image API enables users to create, update, delete, and list cloud
  images, as well as perform actions such as cloning and resizing images. This
  API streamlines the process of managing cloud images, making it easier for
  users to deploy and scale their cloud infrastructure.
