  OVH Cloud Role API is a powerful tool that allows users to manage access
  control and permissions within their OVH Cloud environment. With this API,
  users can create, update, and delete roles that define what actions a user or
  service account can perform within the OVH Cloud platform. This level of
  control ensures that sensitive data and critical infrastructure are protected
  from unauthorized access or misuse. The OVH Cloud Role API also enables users
  to define granular permissions for specific resources, further enhancing
  security and compliance efforts. Overall, the OVH Cloud Role API provides a
  robust solution for managing access rights and ensuring the integrity of the
  OVH Cloud environment.
