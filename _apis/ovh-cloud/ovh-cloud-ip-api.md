  The OVH Cloud Ip API is a service that allows users to manage and control
  their OVH Cloud IP addresses programmatically. Users can use the API to
  allocate, deallocate, and configure IP addresses for their cloud resources,
  such as virtual servers and load balancers. They can also use the API to
  retrieve information about their IP addresses, such as the associated server
  or location. This enables users to automate the management of their IP
  addresses, making it easier to scale and optimize their cloud infrastructure.
  Overall, the OVH Cloud Ip API simplifies the process of managing IP addresses
  in a cloud environment, enhancing efficiency and flexibility for users.
