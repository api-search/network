  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Education Benefits API provides
  developers with access to a range of data and services related to educational
  benefits and resources available to veterans. This API allows developers to
  retrieve information on programs such as the GI Bill, tuition assistance, and
  vocational training opportunities, as well as eligibility requirements and
  application procedures. Users can also access data on schools and institutions
  approved for VA benefits, including their accreditation status and programs
  offered. The API facilitates seamless integration of VA education benefit
  information into various platforms and applications, ultimately helping to
  support and empower veterans in pursuing their educational and career goals.
