  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Address Validation API is a tool used
  to verify and validate the addresses of veterans and their families within the
  VA system. By cross-referencing the address provided with a national database,
  the API ensures that the information is accurate and up-to-date. This helps to
  prevent potential errors in communication or delivery of essential services to
  veterans, as well as ensuring that their families receive the support they
  need. The VA Address Validation API plays a crucial role in maintaining the
  efficiency and effectiveness of the VAs operations and services for those who
  have served our country.
