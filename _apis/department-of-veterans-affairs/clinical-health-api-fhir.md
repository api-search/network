description: >-
  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Clinical Health API (FHIR) is a tool
  that allows healthcare providers and organizations to securely access and
  share critical health information of veterans. This API uses Fast Healthcare
  Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards to standardize the exchange of
  electronic health records and clinical data, enabling seamless communication
  and collaboration among different healthcare systems. By using this API,
  healthcare professionals can easily access a veteran's medical history, lab
  results, medications, and other vital health information to provide more
  efficient and coordinated care. This technology ultimately aims to improve the
  quality of healthcare services for veterans and enhance their overall health
  outcomes.
