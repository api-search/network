  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Loan Review API is a software
  application that allows authorized users to access and review details about
  VA-guaranteed loans. This API provides real-time information about loan
  conditions, documentation requirements, and borrower eligibility criteria.
  Users can also use the API to check the status of loan applications, update
  loan records, and submit requests for loan modifications. Overall, the VA Loan
  Review API streamlines the loan review process, enhances efficiency, and
  ensures that VA-guaranteed loans are processed accurately and in compliance
  with VA guidelines.
