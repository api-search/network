  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Care Eligibility API is a
  tool that allows healthcare providers and administrators to check whether
  veterans are eligible for community care services. This API provides real-time
  access to the VA's eligibility criteria and guidelines, making it easier for
  medical professionals to determine whether a veteran can receive care outside
  of traditional VA facilities. By streamlining the eligibility verification
  process, this API helps ensure that veterans receive the care they need in a
  timely and efficient manner. Additionally, it helps reduce administrative
  burden for healthcare providers by automating the eligibility verification
  process.
