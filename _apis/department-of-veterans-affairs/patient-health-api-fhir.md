  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Patient Health API (FHIR) is a tool
  that allows healthcare providers to securely access and share patient health
  information from the VA system. This API uses Fast Healthcare Interoperability
  Resources (FHIR) standards to provide a standardized way of exchanging
  electronic health records, allowing for seamless communication between
  different healthcare systems. By leveraging this API, healthcare providers can
  easily access vital patient information such as medical history,
  prescriptions, lab results, and appointments, leading to improved care
  coordination and decision-making. Additionally, the VA Patient Health API
  (FHIR) promotes patient empowerment by enabling individuals to access and
  share their own health data with other providers or applications as needed.
