  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) VA Forms API is a platform that allows
  users to access and retrieve various forms related to VA benefits and
  services. This API provides a central repository for all VA forms, making it
  easier for veterans, their families, and other stakeholders to find and fill
  out the necessary paperwork for applying for benefits, claims, or other
  services. By offering a standardized and efficient way to access forms
  electronically, the VA Forms API streamlines the process of obtaining VA
  assistance and ensures that individuals have the necessary documents to
  support their needs and eligibility for benefits.
