  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veteran Confirmation API is a tool
  that allows authorized users to verify the military service and veteran status
  of individuals seeking benefits or services from the VA. By accessing this
  API, organizations and government agencies can securely confirm a person's
  military background and eligibility for VA benefits, such as healthcare,
  education, and disability compensation. This API streamlines the verification
  process and ensures that only deserving veterans receive the assistance they
  need. With accurate and up-to-date information, the Veterans Confirmation API
  helps prevent fraud and abuse within the VA system, ultimately improving the
  efficiency and effectiveness of services provided to our nation's veterans.
