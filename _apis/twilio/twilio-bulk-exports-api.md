description: >-
  The BulkExport API allows users to easily retrieve all activity logs from the
  Twilio platform in a streamlined manner. Users can choose to download logs
  either on a recurring basis or as a one-time download. With BulkExport, users
  can access daily dumps of Messages, Calls, Conferences, or conference
  Participants from the previous day without having to paginate through the list
  resource. These files are automatically deleted after seven days.
  Additionally, users can generate historical daily dumps for a specified range
  of dates using BulkExport.
