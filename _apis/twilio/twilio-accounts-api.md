description: >-
  The Twilio Accounts API enables developers to programmatically manage their
  Twilio accounts, allowing them to create and configure subaccounts, retrieve
  account information, and update account details. Through this API, developers
  can automate account management processes, such as creating new subaccounts
  for different projects or teams, adjusting account settings, and reviewing
  account usage statistics. This API provides a seamless way for developers to
  access and manipulate account information, making it easier to effectively
  manage multiple Twilio accounts in a streamlined and automated manner.
