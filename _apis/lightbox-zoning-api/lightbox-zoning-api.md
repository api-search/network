  Zoning data is a critical piece of decision making for the CRE and
  builder/developer markets, giving insights into what a property is zoned for,
  zoning districts, setback requirements, floor area ration (FAR), building
  height, and more. This data when coupled with SmartFabric offers a customer a
  more robust view of parcels without the time consuming, costly, and tedious
  collection of zoning information; and may even serve to bring this part of
  their workflow in-house (many companies will outsource this data collection to
  companies like PZR).
