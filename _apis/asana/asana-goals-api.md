description: >-
  The Asana Goals API is a powerful tool that allows developers to
  programmatically interact with and manipulate goals within the Asana platform.
  By utilizing the API, users can create, update, and track progress on goals,
  as well as set key results and milestones to measure success. This enables
  teams to align on business objectives, monitor performance, and adjust
  strategies as needed. The Asana Goals API streamlines the goal tracking
  process, making it more efficient and collaborative for teams to work towards
  their collective goals.
