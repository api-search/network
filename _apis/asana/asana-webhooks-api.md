description: >-
  Asana Webhooks API allows developers to receive real-time updates about
  changes and events happening within Asana. By setting up webhooks, users can
  subscribe to specific events such as task creation, task completion, or
  project updates, and receive notifications in the form of HTTP POST requests.
  This allows for seamless integration and automation of workflows, as users can
  react to changes in Asana data immediately and trigger actions in external
  systems. With Asana Webhooks API, developers can build custom integrations
  that enhance collaboration and streamline project management processes.
