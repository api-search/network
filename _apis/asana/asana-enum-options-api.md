description: >-
  The Asana Enum Options API is a tool that allows users to retrieve and manage
  information about enum options within their Asana projects. Enum options are
  pre-defined choices that users can select from when filling out specific
  fields or customizing their project settings. With this API, users can
  programmatically access and update enum options, making it easier to maintain
  consistency and accuracy across their projects. By automating the retrieval
  and management of enum options, the Asana Enum Options API helps to streamline
  project workflows and ensure that data remains organized and up-to-date.
