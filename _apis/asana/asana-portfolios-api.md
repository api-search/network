  Asana Portfolios API allows developers to access and manage portfolios in the
  Asana platform programmatically. With this API, users can create, update, and
  delete portfolios, as well as add projects and tasks to them. By using this
  API, developers can automate portfolio management processes, track progress,
  and visualize project data in a more efficient manner. This API provides the
  necessary tools for integrating portfolios into custom applications and
  workflows, enabling users to better organize their projects and track their
  team's progress.
