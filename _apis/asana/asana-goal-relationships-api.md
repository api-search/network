  The Asana Goal Relationships API allows users to create and manage
  relationships between different goals within their Asana workspace. This API
  enables users to define dependencies between goals, track progress, and
  visualize the overall hierarchy and connections between various goals. By
  using this API, businesses and teams can gain a better understanding of how
  different goals align with each other and make strategic decisions to
  prioritize their objectives more effectively. Additionally, the API provides
  insights into the interconnectedness of goals, helping users to identify
  potential roadblocks and plan more efficiently to achieve their desired
  outcomes.
