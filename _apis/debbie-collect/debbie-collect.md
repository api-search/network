  The Debbie APIs are a RESTful interface, allowing you to programmatically
  update, add and access much of your data on the platform. It provides
  predictable URLs for accessing resources, and uses built-in HTTP features to
  receive commands and return responses. This makes it easy to communicate with
  third party systems.
