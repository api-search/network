  The United States International Trade Commission is an independent,
  nonpartisan, quasi-judicial federal agency that fulfills a range of
  trade-related mandates. We provide high-quality, leading-edge analysis of
  international trade issues to the President and the Congress. The
  Commission is a highly regarded forum for the adjudication of intellectual
  property and trade disputes.
