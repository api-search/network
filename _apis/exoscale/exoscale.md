  The Exoscale API is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with their
  Exoscale cloud infrastructure programmatically. With the API, users can
  automate tasks, manage resources, and access data on their virtual machines,
  storage, and networking components. By utilizing the API, users can easily
  scale their infrastructure up or down, deploy new services, and monitor the
  performance of their systems in real-time. The Exoscale API simplifies the
  management of cloud resources and enables users to customize their
  infrastructure to meet their specific needs.
