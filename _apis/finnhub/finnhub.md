  The API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented
  URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and
  uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs. This is 1 of the
  most comprehensive financial API available on the market.
