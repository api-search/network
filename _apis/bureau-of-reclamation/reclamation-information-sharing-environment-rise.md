description: >-
  This API allows users to query RISE data programmatically and return a
  JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object. For Geospatial and File Upload
  datasets, only the metadata (the descriptive information about each dataset)
  can be queried from the API. For time series datasets, both the metadata and
  data can be queried.
