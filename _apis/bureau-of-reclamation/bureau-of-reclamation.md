  Established in 1902, the Bureau of Reclamation is best known for the dams,
  powerplants, and canals it constructed in the 17 western states. These water
  projects led to homesteading and promoted the economic development of the
  West. Reclamation has constructed more than 600 dams and reservoirs including
  Hoover Dam on the Colorado River and Grand Coulee on the Columbia River.
