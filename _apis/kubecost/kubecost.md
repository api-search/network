  The Budget API allows you to create, update, and delete recurring budget rules
  to control your Kubernetes spending. Weekly and monthly budgets can be
  established on workloads to set limits on cost spend, with the option to
  configure alerts for reaching specified budget thresholds via email, Slack, or
  Microsoft Teams.
