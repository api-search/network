  access their account on a BigCommerce site by logging in using a single set of

  their user experience. By implementing SSO, businesses can improve customer
  satisfaction, reduce friction during the checkout process, and potentially
  increase conversions. Additionally, SSO enhances security by centralizing
  authentication and authorization, making it easier for businesses to manage
  user access and permissions across their platforms. Overall, BigCommerce
  Customer Login (SSO) is a valuable tool for both customers and businesses
  seeking a more streamlined and secure online shopping experience.
