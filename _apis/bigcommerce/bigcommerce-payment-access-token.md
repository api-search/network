  The BigCommerce Payment Access Token is a secure and unique identifier that
  allows merchants to securely process payments through their online store. This
  token acts as a virtual key that grants access to the merchant's payment
  gateway, allowing them to accept various payment methods such as credit cards,
  digital wallets, and bank transfers. By using the Payment Access Token,
  merchants can streamline their checkout process and provide a seamless and
  secure payment experience for their customers. Additionally, this token helps
  protect sensitive payment information and reduce the risk of fraud, ultimately
  enhancing the overall security of the online payment system.
