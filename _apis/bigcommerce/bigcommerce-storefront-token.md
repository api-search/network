  BigCommerce Storefront Tokens are a form of secure and unique codes that are
  generated to grant access to specific functionalities and features within a
  BigCommerce store. These tokens serve as a form of authentication and
  authorization mechanism, allowing users to perform various actions such as
  viewing products, adding items to their cart, and completing transactions. By
  utilizing Storefront Tokens, BigCommerce ensures that only authorized users
  are able to access certain parts of the store and helps to protect sensitive
  information from unauthorized access. Additionally, Storefront Tokens enhance
  the overall security of the store by adding an extra layer of protection
  against fraudulent activities and unauthorized access attempts.
