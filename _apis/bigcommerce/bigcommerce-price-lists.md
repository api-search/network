  BigCommerce Price Lists is a feature that allows merchants to create and
  manage different pricing structures for their products. This enables
  businesses to tailor pricing to specific customer groups, such as wholesale
  buyers or VIP customers, and offer discounts or promotions on certain items.
  Price Lists also help streamline the process of updating prices across a large
  inventory, making it easier for businesses to stay competitive and maximize
  profitability. By giving merchants more control over pricing strategies,
  BigCommerce Price Lists empowers businesses to better serve their customers
  and drive sales growth.
