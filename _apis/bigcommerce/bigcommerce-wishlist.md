  BigCommerce Wishlist is a feature that allows customers to save products they
  are interested in to a personalized list for future reference. This enables
  them to easily keep track of items they like without having to immediately
  purchase them. Customers can create multiple wishlists, organize products by
  category, and share their lists with friends and family. This tool enhances
  the shopping experience by giving customers the ability to compile a curated
  selection of items they may want to buy later, ultimately increasing
  engagement and driving sales for merchants.
