  BigCommerce Tax Classes is a feature within the BigCommerce platform that
  allows merchants to easily assign tax rates to different products or
  categories based on the unique tax requirements of each item. By organizing
  products into specific tax classes, merchants can ensure that the correct tax
  rates are applied to each purchase, simplifying the process of tax collection
  and compliance. This feature is especially useful for merchants who sell a
  variety of products with different tax rates, such as clothing, electronics,
  or food items. With BigCommerce Tax Classes, merchants can streamline their
  tax calculation processes and ensure accurate tax reporting for their online
  store.
