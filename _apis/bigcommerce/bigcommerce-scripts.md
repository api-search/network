  BigCommerce Scripts is a feature within the BigCommerce platform that allows
  users to customize and enhance their online store through the use of
  JavaScript. With Scripts, users can add functionality to their store, such as
  pop-ups, countdown timers, and custom forms, without needing to manually edit
  their store's code. Additionally, Scripts can be used to track user behavior,
  set up A/B testing, and implement personalized experiences for customers. By
  providing a flexible and easy-to-use tool for adding custom code to their
  store, BigCommerce Scripts empowers users to create a more dynamic and
  engaging online shopping experience for their customers.
