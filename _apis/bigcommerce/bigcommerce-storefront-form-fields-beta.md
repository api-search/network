  The BigCommerce Storefront Form Fields (Beta) feature enables merchants to
  easily customize the appearance and functionality of their online store's
  forms. With this tool, users can add, remove, or reorder form fields in their
  storefront checkout process, such as adding new fields for customer
  information or payment options. This feature provides more control over the
  design and user experience of the checkout process, helping merchants to
  create a streamlined and seamless online shopping experience for their
  customers. Additionally, the ability to customize form fields can help
  businesses collect important data and insights from their customers,
  ultimately leading to improved customer engagement and conversion rates.
