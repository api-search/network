description: >-
  BigCommerce Payment Methods (Deprecated) was a feature within the BigCommerce
  platform that allowed merchants to accept a variety of payment methods from
  customers during checkout. This feature provided users with the ability to
  easily configure and manage multiple payment gateways, such as PayPal, Stripe,
  and Authorize.Net, to offer customers a seamless and secure payment
  experience. Unfortunately, this feature has been deprecated by BigCommerce and
  is no longer supported. Merchants are encouraged to explore and utilize
  alternative payment methods available within the platform to best meet their
  business needs and preferences.
