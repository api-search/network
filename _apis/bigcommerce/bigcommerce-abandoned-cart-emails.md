  BigCommerce Abandoned Cart Emails is a feature that allows online retailers to
  automatically send personalized emails to customers who have added items to
  their shopping cart but failed to complete their purchase. These emails are
  designed to remind customers of the products they were interested in, provide
  a gentle nudge to complete their purchase, and potentially offer discounts or
  incentives to incentivize them to return to the website and complete their
  transaction. By leveraging this feature, businesses can recover potentially
  lost revenue and improve overall conversion rates.
