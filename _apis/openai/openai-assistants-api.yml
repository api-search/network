description: >-
  The Assistants API allows you to build AI assistants within your own
  applications. An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools,
  and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API currently
  supports three types of tools - Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function
  calling. In the future, we plan to release more OpenAI-built tools, and allow
  you to provide your own tools on our platform.
