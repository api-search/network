  This guide will show the basics of verifying accounts using Yodlee. Account
  verification can help enable payments, avoid overdrafts, reduce fraud, and
  more.  Verifying an account simply means your user has authenticated against
  the account, and then you get detailed information for the problem you're
  trying to solve. For instance, for payments, you might want to prove a user
  has access to an account, get the account routing number, and check the amount
  of money in it.
