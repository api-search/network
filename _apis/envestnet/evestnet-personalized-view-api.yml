description: >-
  Views APIs enable your end users to create personalized views of their
  finances for any expenses, hobbies, or projects relevant to them. A view is a
  collection of transactions based on rules - any combination of accounts,
  categories, merchants, locations, transaction types, and more, that are of
  interest to your users. Build preconfigured views and let your users further
  define them with a flexible user experience. This document details the APIs
  offered as part of the views product.
