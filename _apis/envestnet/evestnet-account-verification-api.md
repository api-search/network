  This guide will show the basics of verifying accounts using Yodlee.
  Account verification can help enable payments, avoid overdrafts, reduce
  fraud, and more.  Verifying an account simply means your user has
  authenticated against the account, and then you get detailed information
  for the problem you're trying to solve. For instance, for payments, you
  might want to prove a user has access to an account, get the account
  routing number, and check the amount of money in it.
