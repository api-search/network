  The purpose of the API is to provide data for software/web developers to build
  satellite tracking or prediction applications.The REST API v1 is free but it
  is transaction limited. The current limit is 1000 transactions/hour. If you
  need more traffic, contact us. Users are requested not to abuse the system,
  and not use multiple license keys to get around the hourly transation limit.
  Traffic is monitored and logged. When the API is used in improper ways, user
  access will be limited or blocked. ~ https://www.n2yo.com/api/
