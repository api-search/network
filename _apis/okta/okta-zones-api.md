  The Okta Zones API is a tool that allows developers to manage and configure
  the geographical regions where their Okta accounts are hosted. With this API,
  users can easily create and manage different zones to ensure that their data
  is stored and processed in the most secure and efficient manner possible. By
  using the Zones API, developers can set up specific rules and policies for
  different regions, control access to resources, and monitor the performance of
  their Okta accounts in real-time. Overall, the Okta Zones API provides users
  with the flexibility and control they need to optimize their Okta account
  settings based on their specific needs and requirements.
