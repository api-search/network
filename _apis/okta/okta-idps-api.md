description: >-
  The Okta IDPS API allows organizations to integrate their existing intrusion
  detection and prevention systems with Okta's identity and access management
  platform. This API enables users to centrally manage and monitor security
  policies, alerting and response workflows, and incident investigations across
  all of their systems and applications. By leveraging the Okta IDPS API,
  organizations can ensure consistent security controls and policies are
  enforced, detect and respond to security threats in real-time, and streamline
  the management of security incidents. Ultimately, the Okta IDPS API helps
  organizations enhance their overall security posture and protect against
  cybersecurity threats.
