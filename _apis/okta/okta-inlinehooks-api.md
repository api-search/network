  Okta Inlinehooks API is a feature provided by Okta that allows developers to
  customize and extend the authentication and authorization workflow within
  their applications. Using Inlinehooks, developers can integrate custom logic
  and processes at various points during the authentication process, such as
  user registration, password reset, or login verification. This API gives
  developers the flexibility to implement additional security measures, enforce
  custom policies, and streamline user management tasks. By leveraging Okta
  Inlinehooks API, developers can create a more tailored and secure
  authentication experience for their users.
