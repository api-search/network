description: >-
  Okta Logs API is a tool that allows users to access and analyze log data
  generated by the Okta Identity Cloud platform. This API provides a centralized
  location for viewing and managing logs related to user authentication, access
  control, and system operations. Users can retrieve log entries in real-time,
  filter and search for specific events, and create custom reports to gain
  insights into user activities and security events. With Okta Logs API,
  organizations can monitor and track user interactions, troubleshoot issues,
  and ensure compliance with security policies and regulations. Additionally,
  this API enables integration with third-party security information and event
  management (SIEM) systems for a comprehensive approach to monitoring and
  managing identity and access controls.
