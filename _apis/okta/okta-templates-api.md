description: >-
  The Okta Templates API is a tool that allows developers to create and manage
  custom templates for their organization's Okta account. These templates can be
  used to automate the process of setting up users, groups, and applications in
  Okta, making it easier to onboard new employees and streamline access to the
  resources they need. With the Templates API, developers can define the
  attributes and configurations that are required for different types of users
  and roles within their organization, ensuring consistent and secure access
  management practices. Additionally, the API supports versioning and lifecycle
  management of templates, making it easy to update and maintain them over time.
  Overall, the Okta Templates API helps organizations improve their identity and
  access management processes by providing a flexible and scalable way to define
  and enforce access policies within their Okta environment.
