  The Okta Authorization Servers API allows developers to create and manage
  custom authorizations servers within the Okta Identity Platform. This API
  enables users to define specific rules and policies for accessing resources
  and services, as well as managing scopes and permissions. By leveraging the
  Okta Authorization Servers API, developers can easily implement secure and
  fine-grained access control mechanisms for their applications, ensuring that
