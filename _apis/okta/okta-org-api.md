description: >-
  Okta Org API allows organizations to programmatically manage their Okta
  accounts, users, and groups. With the Org API, organizations can automate
  tasks such as user provisioning and deprovisioning, group management, and
  account configuration. This API provides a secure and efficient way for
  organizations to streamline their Okta administration processes and ensure
  that their identity and access management systems are always up-to-date. By
  leveraging the Okta Org API, organizations can easily integrate their Okta
  accounts with other systems and applications, giving them greater control over
  their identity and access management processes.
