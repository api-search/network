  The News Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get back a list
  of news that are relevant to the search query. This section provides technical
  details about the query parameters and headers that you use to request news
  and the JSON response objects that contain them. For examples that show how to
  make requests, see [Searching the web for
  news](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-news-search/search-the-web).
