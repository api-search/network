  The Computer Vision API provides state-of-the-art algorithms to process images
  and return information. For example, it can be used to determine if an image
  contains mature content, or it can be used to find all the faces in an image. 
  It also has other features like estimating dominant and accent colors,
  categorizing the content of images, and describing an image with complete
  English sentences.  Additionally, it can also intelligently generate images
  thumbnails for displaying large images effectively.
