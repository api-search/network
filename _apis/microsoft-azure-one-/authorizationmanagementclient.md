description: >-
  Role based access control provides you a way to apply granular level policy
  administration down to individual resources or resource groups. These
  operations enable you to manage role definitions and role assignments. A role
  definition describes the set of actions that can be performed on resources. A
  role assignment grants access to Azure Active Directory users.
