  The Image Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get back a list
  of relevant images. This section provides technical details about the query
  parameters and headers that you use to request images and the JSON response
  objects that contain them. For examples that show how to make requests, see
  [Searching the Web for
  Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/search-the-web).
