  Autosuggest supplies search terms derived from a root text sent to the
  service.  The terms Autosuggest supplies are related to the root text based on
  similarity and their frequency or ratings of usefulness in other searches. For
  examples that show how to use Autosuggest, see [Search using
  AutoSuggest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-autosuggest-api-v7-reference).
