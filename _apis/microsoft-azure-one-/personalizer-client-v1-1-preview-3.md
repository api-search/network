description: >-
  Personalizer Service is an Azure Cognitive Service that makes it easy to
  target content and experiences without complex pre-analysis or cleanup of past
  data. Given a context and featurized content, the Personalizer Service returns
  which content item to show to users in rewardActionId. As rewards are sent in
  response to the use of rewardActionId, the reinforcement learning algorithm
  will improve the model and improve performance of future rank calls.
