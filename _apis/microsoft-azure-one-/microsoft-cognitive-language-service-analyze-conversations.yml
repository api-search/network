name: Microsoft Cognitive Language Service - Analyze Conversations
description: >-
  The language service conversations API is a suite of natural language
  processing (NLP) skills that can be used to analyze structured conversations
  (textual or spoken). The synchronous API in this suite accepts a request and
  mediates among multiple language projects, such as LUIS Generally Available,
  Question Answering, Conversational Language Understanding, and then calls the
  best candidate service to handle the request. At last, it returns a response
  with the candidate service's response as a payload.

   In some cases, this API needs to forward requests and responses between the caller and an upstream service. The asynchronous APIs in this suite enable tasks like Conversation Summarization and Conversational PII detection.
