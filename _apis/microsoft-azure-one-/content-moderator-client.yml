description: "You use the API to scan your content as it's generated. Content Moderator then processes your content and sends the results, along with relevant information, either back to your systems or to the built-in review tool. You can use this information to make decisions, like taking it down or sending it to a human judge.\r\n\r\nWhen you're using the API, images need to have a minimum of 128 pixels and a maximum file size of 4 MB. \r\nText can be at most 1,024 characters long. \r\nIf the content passed to the text API or the image API exceeds the size limits, the API will return an error code that informs you about the issue."
