  The Entity Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get back search
  results that include entities and places. Place results include restaurants,
  hotel, or other local businesses. For places, the query can specify the name
  of the local business or it can ask for a list (for example, restaurants near
  me). Entity results include persons, places, or things. Place in this context
  is tourist attractions, states, countries, etc.
