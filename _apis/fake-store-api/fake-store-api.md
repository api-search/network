  Fake Store API is a tool that allows users to access a database of fake
  products, customers, and orders. Users can use the API to generate test data
  for their e-commerce applications or to practice integrating with external
  APIs. The Fake Store API provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for
  retrieving information such as product details, customer information, and
  order history. By using this API, developers can simulate real-world scenarios
  and test the functionality of their applications without having to use actual
  data.
