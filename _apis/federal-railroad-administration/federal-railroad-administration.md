  The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is an agency within the U.S.
  Department of Transportation that is responsible for regulating and overseeing
  the safety and efficiency of the nation's railroad systems. The FRA sets and
  enforces safety standards for railroads, conducts inspections and
  investigations to ensure compliance with regulations, and provides funding and
  support for key rail infrastructure projects. In addition to safety oversight,
  the FRA also works to promote the development of high-speed rail and improve
  the overall performance of the railroad industry. By working with industry
  stakeholders, state and local governments, and other federal agencies, the FRA
  plays a critical role in ensuring the safe and reliable operation of the
  nation's railroads.
