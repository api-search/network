  Vtex SKU Bindings is a tool within the Vtex platform that allows users to
  manage and organize product variants effectively. By creating and assigning
  SKUs (stock keeping units) to different product attributes such as size,
  color, and style, users can easily track and manage inventory levels, pricing,
  and availability for each specific product variant. This streamlined process
  ensures accurate product information and efficient order fulfillment,
  ultimately enhancing the overall customer shopping experience. With Vtex SKU
  Bindings, businesses can easily create and manage a diverse range of product
  offerings while maintaining consistency and accuracy across their entire
  product catalog.
