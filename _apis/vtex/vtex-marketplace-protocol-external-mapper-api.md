  The Vtex Marketplace Protocol External Mapper is a tool that allows sellers to
  seamlessly integrate their external catalogs, inventory, and prices with the
  Vtex platform. This mapping tool simplifies the process of connecting and
  synchronizing data between the seller's existing systems and the Vtex
  Marketplace, ensuring accurate and up-to-date product information for
  customers. By automating the mapping process, sellers can efficiently manage
  their inventory, prices, and product listings across multiple channels,
  ultimately improving the overall customer shopping experience on the Vtex
  Marketplace.
