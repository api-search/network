  The Vtex Marketplace Protocol External Seller Marketplace is a platform
  designed to facilitate transactions between external sellers and buyers within
  the Vtex ecosystem. It allows third-party sellers to list their products on
  the marketplace, where customers can browse and make purchases. The protocol
  provides a secure and efficient system for sellers to manage their inventory,
  prices, and orders, while also providing buyers with a seamless shopping
  experience. By leveraging the Vtex Marketplace Protocol, external sellers can
  expand their reach, increase their sales, and tap into a larger customer base.
