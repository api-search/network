  The Order API is part of the eBay Buy APIs. It is used to purchase items and
  track the purchase orders. The Order API supports the complete guest checkout
  process. Use the Order API with the other Buy APIs to create a buying
  application that lets guest users buy from eBay sellers without visiting the
  eBay site. The Buy APIs provide the ability to purchase eBay items from your
  app or website.
