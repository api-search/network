  eBay Fulfillment API is a service that allows sellers to outsource their order
  fulfillment processing to eBay's network of warehouses and logistics
  providers. By integrating with this API, sellers can automate the process of
  managing and shipping their products, including storing inventory, picking and
  packing orders, and coordinating shipping and delivery. This helps sellers
  streamline their operations, improve efficiency, and provide a better overall
  experience for their customers. Additionally, eBay Fulfillment API provides
  real-time tracking and reporting capabilities, giving sellers full visibility
  into the status of their orders and inventory levels.
