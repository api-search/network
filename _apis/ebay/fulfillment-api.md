description: >-
  The outcome of a buyer's eBay checkout process is an order. This API enables
  sellers to manage the completion of an order in accordance with the payment
  method and timing specified at checkout. The line items in the order are
  grouped into one or more packages. As the seller addresses, handles, and ships
  each package, the set of specifications for this process is known as a
  fulfillment. Use the Fulfillment API to facilitate and monitor these
  activities from the order to completion. Sellers' status on eBay depend partly
  on their record of timely fulfillment.
