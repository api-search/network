description: >-
  The Client Registration API provides Dynamic Client Registration for regulated
  Third Party Providers (TPPs) who are, or will be, engaged in financial
  transactions on behalf of individuals domiciled in the EU/UK. This is required
  by the EU's Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) which requires all
  regulated Account Servicing Payment Service Providers (ASPSPs) to provide
  secure APIs to access account and payment services on behalf of account
  holders.
