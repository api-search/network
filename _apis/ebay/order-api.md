  The eBay Order API is a tool that allows users to manage their orders,
  transactions, and fulfillment processes on the eBay platform. With this API,
  sellers can retrieve detailed information about their orders, such as shipping
  details, payment status, and buyer information. They can also update order
  status, mark items as shipped, print shipping labels, and handle returns and
  cancellations. Additionally, the eBay Order API provides insights into sales
  performance, order trends, and customer preferences, helping sellers make
  informed decisions to grow their business on eBay. Overall, the eBay Order API
  streamlines the order management process, enhances efficiency, and improves
