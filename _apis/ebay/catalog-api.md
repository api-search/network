  The eBay Catalog API is a tool that allows developers to access detailed
  information about products listed on the eBay platform. It provides a
  centralized database of product catalog data, such as product specifications,
  images, and identifiers, which can be used to enhance product listings and
  improve search results. By utilizing the eBay Catalog API, developers can
  streamline the process of listing products on eBay, ensure accurate and
  consistent product information, and enhance the overall shopping experience
  for eBay users. This API ultimately helps sellers and buyers connect more
  effectively on the platform by providing a comprehensive and reliable source
  of product information.
