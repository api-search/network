description: >-
  The eBay Charity API is a tool that allows organizations to raise funds for
  their causes through online auctions on eBay. By using the API, charities can
  showcase their items or experiences to a wider audience and receive donations
  from individuals who bid on and purchase these items. The API enables
  integration with eBay's platform, making it easier for charities to manage
  their fundraising efforts and reach potential donors. Additionally, the API
  provides a transparent and secure way for charities to receive donations,
  ultimately helping them raise more funds to support their important work.
