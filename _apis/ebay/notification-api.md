  eBay Notification API is a service offered by eBay that allows users to
  receive real-time updates and notifications about their eBay account and
  transactions. This API allows users to set up alerts for important events such
  as items being sold, bids being placed, payments being made, and shipments
  being sent. Users can customize the types of alerts they receive and how they
  are delivered, such as through email, text message, or in-app notifications.
  By using the eBay Notification API, users can stay informed and up-to-date on
  their eBay activity, helping them to manage their account more effectively and
  efficiently.
