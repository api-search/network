  The eBay Taxonomy API is a tool that helps sellers categorize their products
  accurately on the eBay platform. By providing a structured framework of
  product categories and item specifics, the API allows sellers to easily
  identify the most relevant category for their listings. This helps ensure that
  items are searchable and discoverable by buyers, improving the chances of
  making a sale. The eBay Taxonomy API also helps sellers comply with eBay's
  product listing policies and guidelines, ultimately leading to a smoother and
  more successful selling experience on the platform.
