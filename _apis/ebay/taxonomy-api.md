description: >-
  Use the Taxonomy API to discover the most appropriate eBay categories under
  which sellers can offer inventory items for sale, and the most likely
  categories under which buyers can browse or search for items to purchase. In
  addition, the Taxonomy API provides metadata about the required and
  recommended category aspects to include in listings, and also has two
  operations to retrieve parts compatibility information.
