  The Translation API provides machine translation to help bring inventory to
  new markets. The Translation API translates common commerce content, such as
  the title of an item to help present marketplace listings to buyers in
  different countries or regions. The Translation API takes foreign language
  search queries from the buyer and translates them for the target marketplace,
  as well.
