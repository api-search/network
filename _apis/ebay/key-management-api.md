  The eBay Key Management API provides developers with a secure and efficient
  way to manage access to their eBay resources. It allows users to generate and
  manage API keys, which are necessary for making authenticated calls to the
  eBay platform. With this API, developers can easily create, update, and revoke
  API keys, as well as monitor their usage and security status. The Key
  Management API also provides detailed documentation and guidelines on best
  practices for securing and managing API keys, helping developers to ensure the
  integrity and security of their applications. By using this API, developers
  can enhance the security of their eBay integrations and streamline the process
  of managing access to eBay resources.
