  The eBay Offer API allows sellers to create, update, and manage their offers
  on the eBay marketplace. This API enables sellers to retrieve information
  about their existing offers, as well as schedule, revise, and publish new
  offers. Sellers can also use the Offer API to set prices, quantities, and
  promotional discounts for their products. Additionally, sellers can customize
  their offers by specifying shipping options, return policies, and other
  details. By leveraging the eBay Offer API, sellers can efficiently control and
  optimize their product listings to maximize sales and reach a wider audience
  of potential buyers.
