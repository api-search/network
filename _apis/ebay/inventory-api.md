  The eBay Inventory API is a tool that allows sellers to manage and update
  their inventory on the eBay platform. With this API, sellers can create,
  update, and delete inventory items, as well as track quantities, pricing, and
  availability in real-time. This API also allows sellers to automate processes
  such as listing new items, re-pricing inventory, and managing out-of-stock
  items. Overall, the eBay Inventory API streamlines inventory management for
  sellers, saving them time and helping them stay organized and competitive in
  the online marketplace.
