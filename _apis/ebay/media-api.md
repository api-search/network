  The eBay Media API is a tool provided by eBay that allows developers to access
  and interact with media assets related to eBay listings. This API enables
  users to retrieve and display images, videos, and other multimedia content
  associated with eBay products, helping to create a more engaging and visually
  appealing shopping experience for customers. By utilizing the Media API,
  developers can easily integrate high-quality media assets into their
  applications, enhancing the overall presentation of eBay listings and
  potentially driving higher conversion rates and customer satisfaction.
  Additionally, this API offers features for managing media assets, such as
  uploading, updating, and deleting images and videos, giving developers greater
  control over the visual content displayed on their platforms.
