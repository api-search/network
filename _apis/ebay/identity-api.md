description: >-
  eBay Identity API is a tool that allows developers to integrate eBay's secure
  authentication and authorization services into their applications. With this
  API, users can securely log in to their eBay accounts, access their personal
  information, and make purchases without having to leave the app. The API also
  helps developers implement two-factor authentication and other security
  measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. Overall, eBay
  Identity API streamlines the user experience and enhances security for both
  developers and eBay customers.
