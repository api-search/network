description: >-
  The Negotiation API gives sellers the ability to engage in sales negotiations
  with buyers. The API currently supports only the ability for sellers to extend
  offers to buyers who have shown an interest in their listings. The ability to
  partake in more detailed negotiations will increase as the functionality of
  the API is expanded.
