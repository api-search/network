  eBay Negotiation API allows sellers to offer buyers discounted prices or
  bundle deals on listed items. It provides a platform for buyers and sellers to
  negotiate on price and terms, ultimately reaching a mutually beneficial
  agreement. The API facilitates real-time communication between parties,
  enabling them to discuss pricing, shipping options, and any other terms of the
  sale. This tool streamlines the negotiation process, making it easier for
  buyers and sellers to come to a fair deal that satisfies both parties.
