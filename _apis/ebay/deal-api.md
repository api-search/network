  The eBay Deal API is a service provided by eBay that allows developers to
  access and retrieve information about the latest deals and promotions
  available on the eBay platform. This API enables developers to
  programmatically retrieve data such as discounted prices, limited-time offers,
  and special promotions on a wide range of products across various categories.
  By utilizing the eBay Deal API, developers can create powerful applications
  that help users find the best deals, save money, and make more informed
  purchasing decisions on the eBay marketplace. Additionally, the API allows
  developers to customize and personalize the deal information based on user
  preferences and shopping habits, further enhancing the overall shopping
  experience for eBay customers.
