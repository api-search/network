  Bunq User Notification Filter Email API is a tool that allows users to filter
  and customize the emails they receive from Bunq, a mobile banking app. This
  API enables users to set up specific criteria and rules to only receive
  notifications about certain transactions, account updates, or other relevant
  information. By using this API, users can tailor their email notifications to
  suit their preferences and ensure they only receive the most important and
  relevant updates from Bunq. This helps users manage their inbox more
  effectively and stay informed about important banking activities without being
  overwhelmed by unnecessary notifications.
