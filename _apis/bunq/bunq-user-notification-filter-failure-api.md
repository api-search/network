  The Bunq User Notification Filter Failure API is a tool that allows users to
  filter notifications based on specific parameters set by the user. This API
  helps users manage the overwhelming amount of notifications they receive by
  allowing them to customize and prioritize which notifications they want to
  see. If there is a failure in the notification filter, this API will alert the
  user so they can address the issue and ensure they are receiving the
  notifications that are most important to them.Overall, the Bunq User
  Notification Filter Failure API provides a more efficient and personalized
  notification system for users to better manage their Bunq account.
