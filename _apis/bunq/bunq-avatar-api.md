  Avatars are public images used to represent you or your company. Avatars are
  used to represent users, monetary accounts and cash registers. Avatars cannot
  be deleted, only replaced. Avatars can be updated after uploading the image
  you would like to use through AttachmentPublic. Using the
  attachment_public_uuid which is returned you can update your Avatar. Avatars
  used for cash registers and company accounts will be reviewed by bunq.
