  The Bunq User Notification Filter Url API allows users to customize and filter
  the notifications they receive from the Bunq app. By providing a URL endpoint,
  users can specify the criteria for which notifications they want to receive,
  such as specifying a certain transaction amount or type of transaction. This
  API empowers users to tailor their notification preferences to their specific
  needs, ensuring they only receive the most relevant and important updates,
  leading to a more streamlined and personalized user experience.
