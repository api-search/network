  The Bunq Installation Installation Server Public Key API allows users to
  securely register and authenticate their devices with the Bunq installation
  server. By generating a unique public key for each device, users can securely
  communicate with the server, ensuring that their data remains private and
  protected. This API streamlines the process of setting up a new device and
  provides a secure method for users to access their Bunq accounts. With strong
  encryption and authentication measures in place, the Installation Installation
  Server Public Key API helps to safeguard user information and maintain the
  integrity of the Bunq platform.
