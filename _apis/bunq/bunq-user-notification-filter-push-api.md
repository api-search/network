  The Bunq User Notification Filter Push API is a tool that allows users to
  customize and filter the notifications they receive from the Bunq banking
  platform. By utilizing this API, users can set specific criteria for the types
  of notifications they want to receive, such as transaction alerts, account
  balance updates, or payment reminders. This level of customization helps users
  stay informed about their finances in a way that is most relevant and useful
  to them. Additionally, the push notification feature ensures that users are
  promptly notified of important updates and changes to their accounts, leading
  to a more streamlined and efficient banking experience.
