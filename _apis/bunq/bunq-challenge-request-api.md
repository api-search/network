  The Bunq Challenge Request API is a tool that allows developers to facilitate
  peer-to-peer payments and split bills easily and efficiently. With this API,
  users can create custom challenges and invite friends or group members to
  contribute funds towards a shared goal or expense. The API enables seamless
  communication and tracking of payments, making it simple for users to manage
  shared expenses and track contributions in real-time. Additionally, the Bunq
  Challenge Request API promotes financial transparency and accountability among
  participants, ensuring that everyone can easily see who has contributed and
  how much is still needed to reach the desired goal.
