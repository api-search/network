  The Bunq Attachment Content API is a tool that allows developers to easily
  manage and access content attached to transactions within the Bunq banking
  system. This API enables users to retrieve, update, and delete various types
  of attachments, such as receipts, invoices, and images, linked to their
  transactions. By using this API, developers can streamline the process of
  organizing and storing transaction-related content, ultimately providing a
  more efficient and user-friendly banking experience for Bunq customers.
