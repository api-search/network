description: >-
  The Bunq Certificate Pinning API is a security feature that helps protect
  users from man-in-the-middle attacks by verifying the authenticity of the
  server's SSL certificate. By implementing certificate pinning, Bunq ensures
  that the app only communicates with servers that have a specific, pre-defined
  SSL certificate, making it extremely difficult for attackers to intercept and
  manipulate the data being sent and received. This extra layer of security
  gives users peace of mind knowing that their sensitive information is being
  transmitted securely and without the risk of being intercepted or tampered
  with.
