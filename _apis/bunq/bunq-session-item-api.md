  The Bunq Session Item API is a tool that allows developers to securely manage
  and access user-specific data within the Bunq banking platform. This API
  enables users to create and modify session items, which are essentially
  temporary containers for storing extra information related to a user's
  session. By utilizing this API, developers can enhance the functionality of
  their applications by storing and retrieving additional data that is relevant
  to a particular user session. This can help to improve the user experience and
  provide more personalized features for Bunq users. Ultimately, the Bunq
  Session Item API makes it easier for developers to create more dynamic and
  interactive applications within the Bunq ecosystem.
