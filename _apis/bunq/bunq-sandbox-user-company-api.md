  The Bunq Sandbox User Company API is a tool that allows developers to easily
  create and manage sample company accounts within the Bunq financial platform
  for testing purposes. This API provides developers with the ability to
  simulate various company profiles, including employees, bank accounts,
  transactions, and more, in order to test and debug their applications in a
  controlled environment. By using the Sandbox User Company API, developers can
  ensure that their integrations with Bunq's services perform as expected before
  deploying them to production, ultimately improving the reliability and
  security of their financial applications.
