  To create integrations, retrieve data, and automate your workflows, build with
  the GitHub REST API. When you make a request to the REST API, you will specify
  an HTTP method and a path. Additionally, you might also specify request
  headers and path, query, or body parameters. The API will return the response
  status code, response headers, and potentially a response body.
