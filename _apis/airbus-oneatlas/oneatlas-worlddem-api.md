  The OneAtlas WorldDEM API is a tool that provides access to high-resolution
  global elevation data. This data, collected by satellites and processed using
  advanced technologies, offers a detailed and accurate representation of the
  Earth's surface. By integrating the WorldDEM API into their applications,
  users can benefit from precise terrain information for a wide range of use
  cases, such as urban planning, disaster response, agriculture, and
  infrastructure development. This API allows developers to easily incorporate
  elevation data into their projects, enabling them to create more accurate and
  effective solutions.
