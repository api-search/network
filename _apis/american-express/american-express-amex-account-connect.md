  AMEX Account Connect is a suite of APIs that enables eligible American Express
  Card Members to add their Cards on file with participating Partners, using
  their American Express login credentials, instead of manually entering the
  Card information. There are two journeys available where the Card Member can
  begin the journey. A User can start from AMEX channels, or from the Partners
  channel to link their eligible American Express Card without needing the Card
  on-hand.
