  Payment Account Reference (PAR) provides an aggregated view of a Card Members
  account activity across different payment formats. Developed by EMV Co, it is
  a non-financial reference generated by American Express Network Services that
  is associated with a Primary Account Number (PAN). PAR links the PAN and
  associated tokens to allow acquirers and Merchants to comply with their
  obligations and provide value-added services to Card Members.
