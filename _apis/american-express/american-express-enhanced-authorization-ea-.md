  American Express Enhanced Authorization (EA) is a fraud prevention tool that
  helps protect cardholders and merchants from unauthorized transactions. EA
  uses advanced algorithms and machine learning technology to analyze
  transaction patterns and detect any suspicious activity. This system enables
  American Express to provide real-time authorization decisions, allowing them
  to quickly identify and block potentially fraudulent transactions. By using
  EA, American Express can minimize the risk of fraud for both cardholders and
  merchants, providing a more secure and seamless payment experience.
