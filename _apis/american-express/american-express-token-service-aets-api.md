  The American Express Token Service (AETS) API is a powerful tool that allows
  developers to securely tokenize cardholder data, providing a layer of security
  for online transactions. By generating unique tokens that represent a
  customer's payment information, the API helps to reduce the risk of data
  breaches and fraud. This technology works by replacing sensitive data with
  randomly generated tokens, ensuring that the original payment details are
  never exposed during transactions. The AETS API enables merchants to securely
  process payments without storing or transmitting sensitive cardholder
  information, ultimately enhancing the security and trustworthiness of online
  payments.
