  FordConnect allows to send vehicle commands (e.g., lock, unlock, etc.) and
  request vehicle information (e.g., fuel range, tire pressure, etc.) to Ford
  and Lincoln vehicles. The API enables FordPass and Lincoln Way customers to
  provide third-party applications access to their connected vehicles.
  FordConnect uses OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow and authorization scopes.
