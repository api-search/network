description: >-
  Feeds are constructed to handle bulk functions. A feed consists of an HTTP
  request with an attached file. The attached file contains the XML representing
  the objects that need to be created or updated. The Walmart APIs version 3.0
  supports only Item and Feed types. Refer to the bulk endpoints in each section
  to see example Feeds for each feed type. Once you upload the Feeds, you can
  use the Feed ID to track the status of the feeds and the status of the item
  within those Feeds.
