  Walmart's Inventory Management API provide drop ship vending (DSV) suppliers
  with mechanisms to update and view current item inventory levels at each ship
  node, also known as fulfillment centers. Suppliers assign each item they
  fulfill drop ship vending (DSV) through one or more ship nodes. Suppliers must
  accurately maintain the item's inventory level at each ship node to ensure
  availability for customer orders.
