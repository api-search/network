name: Walmart Dropship Vendor Lag Time API
description: >-
  Drop ship vending (DSV) suppliers are expected to ship items the day they
  receive the purchase order (PO). However, there may be times when drop ship
  vendors (DSV) have an item that does not ship the same day. This delay is
  called a lag time. These Lag Time requests allow suppliers to update the lag
  time or to view the number of days between when an item is ordered and when it
  is shipped.
