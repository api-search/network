description: "When cardholders are reviewing their card statement, confusion over if a purchase is legitimate is one of the most common occurrances. A cardholders\x19 first reaction when this occurs is typically to pick up the phone to contact the issuing bank, tying up valuable issuer resources in an attempt to identify this purchase and/or pursue a dispute. With digital goods purchases on the rise and currently representing almost 20% of all disputes Visa sees, the potential to see an increase in dispute volume is likely. This can be expensive, as the cost of fielding the telephone calls and working a dispute can be far greater than the purchase amount itself."
