  The Visa Stop Payment Service (VSPS) enables Visa card issuers to stop
  card-on-file payments (including recurring and installment payments) from
  being authorized, cleared, and settled through VisaNet. The service can help
  to provide Visa issuers with a method for handling cardholder stop payment
  requests.
