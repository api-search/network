description: "VisaNet Connect \x13 Issuing APIs are a portfolio of VisaNet Connect APIs that provide direct connectivity to VisaNet for issuers to approve and decline payments requested by their cardholders or process clearing requests submitted by acquirers. The VisaNet Connect \x13 Issuing APIs support a broad range of payment types, including point-of-sale, ecommerce, digital wallets, and ATMs. Connectivity to VisaNet is provided via a lightweight, easy-to-integrate set of RESTful APIs. Additionally, VisaNet Connect \x13 Issuing leverages Visa\x19s HSM-as-a-Service, performing PIN and cryptogram verifications on behalf of the issuer, thereby eliminating the need for the issuer to manage a payment Hardware Security Module (HSM)."
