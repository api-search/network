  The Installments Transaction Service allows you to offer Buy Now Pay Later
  (BNPL) plans to your customers through a set of APIs or on ISO. The plans can
  be offered pre-purchase, during, or post-purchase and give consumers the
  opportunity to pay for qualifying purchases over time. For you, it means
  attracting and retaining a larger customer base with a seamless user
  experience that is scalable and cost effective. For your customers, it means
  more flexibility and control over how and when they choose to pay for goods
  and services.
