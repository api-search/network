  VTAP provides the tools and infrastructure for banks to tokenize fiat
  currencies on blockchain networks. Clients can access and test VTAP
  capabilities through an API layer that connects to blockchain infrastructure
  and utilizes a Visa-developed standard for issuing fiat-backed tokens. Clients
  can access VTAP in a nonvalue Sandbox testing phase that can be used for
  different tokenization use cases._
