  Visa Travel Notification Service helps you avoid mistaken purchase declines
  while your cardholders are traveling by incorporating cardholder self-reported
  travel plans into the VisaNet authorization message. With Visa Travel
  Notification Service, Visa informs you whether your cardholder is transacting
  during the travel dates and at the travel destination they reported, helping
  you more confidently approve transactions when your cardholders make purchases
  while travelling.
