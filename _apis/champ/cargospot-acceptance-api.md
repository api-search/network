  allows cargo handling agents and freight forwarders to streamline and automate
  the acceptance process for air shipments. By integrating this API into their
  systems, users can electronically submit and receive acceptance messages,
  track consignments, and manage bookings in real-time. This helps to reduce
  manual data entry errors, speed up the acceptance process, and improve
  operational efficiency. Additionally, the API provides a customizable
  interface that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of individual users,
  making it a versatile and user-friendly tool for managing air cargo shipments.
