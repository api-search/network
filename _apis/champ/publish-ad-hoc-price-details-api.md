  The CHAMP Cargosystems Publish Ad-Hoc Price Details API is a tool designed to
  provide users with the ability to quickly and easily access and disseminate
  real-time pricing information for cargo shipments. This API allows users to
  input specific details or parameters related to their shipment, such as origin
  and destination locations, type of goods being shipped, and desired delivery
  deadlines. The API then generates a comprehensive and accurate price quote
  based on these inputs, allowing users to make informed decisions about their
  shipping needs. With this API, users can access up-to-date pricing information
  on demand, streamlining the process of securing competitive rates for their
  cargo shipments.
