  Every time dbt Cloud runs a project, it generates and stores information about
  the project. The metadata includes details about your projects models,
  sources, and other nodes along with their execution results. With the dbt
  Cloud Discovery API, you can query this comprehensive information to gain a
  better understanding of your DAG and the data it produces.
