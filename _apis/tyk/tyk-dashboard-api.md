description: >-
  The Tyk Dashboard API offers granular, programmatic access to a centralised
  database of resources that your Tyk nodes can pull from. This API has a
  dynamic user administrative structure which means the secret key that is used
  to communicate with your Tyk nodes can be kept secret and access to the wider
  management functions can be handled on a user-by-user and
  organisation-by-organisation basis.
