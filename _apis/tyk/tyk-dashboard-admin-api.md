  For Tyk On-Premises installations, the Dashboard Admin API provides two
  endpoints for setting up and provisioning a Tyk Dashboard instance without
  using the command line. To use the API, retrieve the admin_secret value from
  your Tyk Dashboard configuration. This secret must be included as a header in
  every Dashboard Admin API request for successful authentication.
