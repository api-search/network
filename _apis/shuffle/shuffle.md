description: >-
  Shuffle started as a project in mid-2019 because of a few automation related
  problems that needed more attention in the CERT/SIRT community. Available
  automation solutions in the security industry are trying to do everything at
  once; handle tickets, indicators, threat intel and much more in a single
  platform, while our goal is to build the best solution to fit all your
  existing tools following the Unix philosophy Do One Thing and Do It Well.
