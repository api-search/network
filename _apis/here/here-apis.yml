description: >-
  RESTful web services that serve different purposes - from search, to
  geocoding, to routing. Whether you're providing truck routing for fleets or
  navigating users through the city with different transport modes, HERE REST
  APIs provide you with everything you need to put location at the heart of your
  app: maps, weather information, batch geocoding, comprehensive routing and
  more. Additional advanced location features include geofencing (entry and exit
  notifications), custom and private roads, speed limits, traffic lights and
  road curvature.
