description: |-
  RESTful web services that serve different purposes - from search, to
  geocoding, to routing. Whether you're providing truck routing for fleets
  or navigating users through the city with different transport modes, HERE
  REST APIs provide you with everything you need to put location at the
  heart of your app: maps, weather information, batch geocoding,
  comprehensive routing and more. Additional advanced location features
  include geofencing (entry and exit notifications), custom and private
  roads, speed limits, traffic lights and road curvature.
