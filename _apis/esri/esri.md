  The Esri API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of tools and
  resources provided by Esri, a leading provider of geographic information
  systems (GIS) software. The API allows developers to integrate Esri's powerful
  mapping and location-based services into their own applications, making it
  easy to visualize, analyze, and interact with spatial data. With the Esri API,
  developers can create custom maps, perform spatial analysis, and build
  interactive geospatial applications that leverage Esri's extensive database of
  geographic data. By utilizing the Esri API, developers can bring the power of
  GIS technology to a wide range of industries and use cases, from urban
  planning and disaster response to retail analytics and environmental
  monitoring.
