  These examples use the search API to search the PLOS corpus of scientific
  articles. These examples are not intended to be a full explanation on the use
  of Solr. A full Solr query language explanation can be found here and a
  tutorial here. The construction of PLOS search queries deviates from the
  standard Solr query URL by using search instead of select when making request
  to the end point.
