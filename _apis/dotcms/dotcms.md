  interact with the dotCMS content management system programmatically. This API
  allows users to create, read, update, and delete content within their dotCMS
  instance, as well as perform various administrative tasks such as managing
  users, roles, and permissions. With the dotCMS API, developers can integrate
  dotCMS with other systems and applications, automate workflows, and extend the
  functionality of their dotCMS instance to meet specific business requirements.
