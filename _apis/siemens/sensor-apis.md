  Siemens Sensor APIs are a set of tools and interfaces that allow developers to
  easily access and integrate sensor data from various Siemens devices, such as
  programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and industrial sensors, into their own
  applications. These APIs provide a standardized way to communicate with
  Siemens sensors, enabling developers to collect real-time data on things like
  temperature, pressure, and motion. By using Siemens Sensor APIs, developers
  can build more efficient and intuitive applications that leverage the power of
  sensor data to improve automation and operational efficiency in industrial
  processes.
