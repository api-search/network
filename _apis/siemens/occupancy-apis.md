  Siemens Occupancy APIs provide a platform for users to access real-time data
  on space utilization within buildings. These APIs utilize sensors and devices
  installed throughout a building to monitor occupancy levels and movement
  patterns. By aggregating and analyzing this data, users can gain insights into
  how spaces are being utilized, identify trends, and optimize their facility
  management strategies. This information can help organizations improve energy
  efficiency, enhance occupant comfort, and make informed decisions about space
  planning and resource allocation. With Siemens Occupancy APIs, users can
  harness the power of data to create smarter, more efficient buildings.
