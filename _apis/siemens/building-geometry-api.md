  Siemens Building Geometry API is a powerful tool that allows developers to
  access and manipulate the geometric data of building models. By using this
  API, users can extract information such as room dimensions, wall angles, and
  window locations to help streamline the design and construction process. With
  this data, designers can create more accurate and efficient building models,
  leading to better decision-making and ultimately, more successful projects.
  The Siemens Building Geometry API is an essential resource for anyone working
  in the architecture, engineering, and construction industries looking to
  optimize their workflow and enhance the overall quality of their designs.
