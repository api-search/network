  In addition to the Content Delivery API (CDA) for published content, is the
  Preview API for previewing both published and unpublished content. It
  maintains the same behaviour and parameters as the CDA, but delivers the
  latest drafts for entries and assets. The Content Preview API is used to
  display the latest version of an entry.
