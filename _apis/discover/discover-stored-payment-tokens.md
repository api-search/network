  Discover Stored Payment Tokens is a secure way for customers to store their
  payment information for future use. By tokenizing the payment data, sensitive
  information such as credit card numbers are replaced with a unique identifier,
  reducing the risk of fraud and unauthorized access. This technology allows
  customers to make quick and seamless transactions without having to re-enter
  their payment details each time. Discover Stored Payment Tokens provides peace
  of mind for both customers and merchants by ensuring that sensitive
  information is protected and transactions are secure.
