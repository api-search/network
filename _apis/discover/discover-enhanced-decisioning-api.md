  Discover Enhanced Decisioning is a fraud product for card-not-present (CNP)
  transactions that enables participants to share enhanced authorization data in
  real time. By sharing enhanced data, the issuer can make a more informed
  decision to either approve or decline a transaction. As a result, participants
  experience higher fraud capture rates, lower false positive fraud declines,
  and increased sales.
