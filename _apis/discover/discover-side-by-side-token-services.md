  SXS tokens are alternate tokens provisioned by a Token Requestor in addition
  to primary tokens they provisioned from front-of-card brands. As the primary
  token may be subject to routing and security enforcement restrictions, the
  alternate token (SXS) provides both routing support and security enforcement
  to participating Debit Networks.
