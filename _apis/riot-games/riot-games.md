  With this site we hope to provide the League of Legends developer community
  with access to game data in a secure and reliable way. This is just part of
  our ongoing effort to respond to players and developers requests for data and
  to arm the community with more ways to contribute to the player experience. We
  want this API to meet the same high standards as our in-game experiences, so
  well be iterating and evolving as we hear your feedback and suggestions (so
  share em all).
