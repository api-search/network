  Climatiq provides a comprehensive toolkit to help businesses measure GHG
  emissions from travel activities. This includes reporting scope 3.6 emissions
  under the GHG Protocol for travel activities in vehicles owned or operated by
  third parties, such as aircraft, trains and passenger cars. Emissions
  associated with hotel stays can also be calculated, providing a comprehensive
  view of travel-related emissions.
