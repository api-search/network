  Instead of using code to specify emission factors you want to use for your
  calculations, you can map your own labels to Climatiq activity IDs in the
  Climatiq dashboard(opens in a new tab), allowing the Climatiq API to recognize
  whatever values you use to categorize your activities. In the dashboard simply
  link a custom mapping label to an activity ID, and this can then be used in
  the custom mapping endpoints.
