name: Mapbox Styles API
description: >-
  The Mapbox Styles API lets you read and change map styles, fonts, and images.
  This API is the basis for Mapbox Studio. If you use Studio, Mapbox GL JS, or
  the Mapbox Mobile SDKs, you are already using the Styles API. This
  documentation is useful for software developers who want to programmatically
  read and write these resources. It isn't necessary for you to read or
  understand this reference to design or use Mapbox maps. You will need to be
  familiar with the Mapbox Style Specification to use the Styles API. The Mapbox
  Style Specification defines the structure of map styles and is the open
  standard that helps Studio communicate with APIs and produce maps that are
  compatible with Mapbox libraries.
