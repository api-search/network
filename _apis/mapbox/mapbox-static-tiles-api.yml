name: Mapbox Static Tiles API
description: >-
  The Mapbox Static Tiles API serves raster tiles generated from Mapbox Studio
  styles. Raster tiles can be used in traditional web mapping libraries like
  Mapbox.js, Leaflet, OpenLayers, and others to create interactive slippy maps.
  The Static Tiles API is well-suited for maps with limited interactivity or use
  on devices that do not support WebGL.
