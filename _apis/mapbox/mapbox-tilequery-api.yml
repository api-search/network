description: >-
  The Mapbox Tilequery API allows you to retrieve data about specific features
  from a vector tileset, based on a given latitude and longitude. The Tilequery
  API makes it possible to query for features within a radius, do
  point-in-polygon queries, query for features in multiple composite layers, and
  augment data from the Mapbox Geocoding API with custom data.
