  The Mapbox Fonts API accepts fonts as raw binary data, allows those fonts
  to be deleted, and generates encoded letters for map renderers. Two types
  of fonts are supported: TrueType fonts, usually with .ttf file extensions,
  and OpenType fonts, with .otf extensions. Fonts are managed on a
  per-account basis. Styles can use any font from the same account.
