  The Mapbox Styles API lets you read and change map styles, fonts, and
  images. This API is the basis for Mapbox Studio. If you use Studio, Mapbox
  GL JS, or the Mapbox Mobile SDKs, you are already using the Styles API.
  This documentation is useful for software developers who want to
  programmatically read and write these resources. It isn't necessary for
  you to read or understand this reference to design or use Mapbox maps. You
  will need to be familiar with the Mapbox Style Specification to use the
  Styles API. The Mapbox Style Specification defines the structure of map
  styles and is the open standard that helps Studio communicate with APIs
  and produce maps that are compatible with Mapbox libraries.
