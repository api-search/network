description: >-
  The Mapbox Datasets API supports reading, creating, updating, and removing
  features from a dataset. Using the Datasets API involves interacting with two
  types of objects: datasets and features. Datasets contain one or more
  collections of GeoJSON features. When you edit a dataset object, you change
  the name and description properties of the dataset itself. When you edit a
  feature object, you edit the contents of the dataset, such as the coordinates
  or properties of a feature.
