name: Mapbox Fonts API
description: >-
  The Mapbox Fonts API accepts fonts as raw binary data, allows those fonts to
  be deleted, and generates encoded letters for map renderers. Two types of
  fonts are supported: TrueType fonts, usually with .ttf file extensions, and
  OpenType fonts, with .otf extensions. Fonts are managed on a per-account
  basis. Styles can use any font from the same account.
