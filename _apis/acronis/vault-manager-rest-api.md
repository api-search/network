  The Acronis Vault Manager REST API is a tool that allows users to manage and
  interact with their Acronis Vault storage solutions programmatically. With the
  REST API, users can automate tasks such as creating, deleting, and updating
  backup vaults, as well as managing access controls and permissions. This API
  also enables users to retrieve information about their vaults and monitor
  their storage usage. By providing a way to integrate Acronis Vault Manager
  functionality into their own applications and workflows, the REST API
  streamlines the management of backup storage and enhances overall data
  protection capabilities.
