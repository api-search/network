  Introducing the Amazon Web Services Clean Rooms ML API Reference, a solution
  that offers a secure way for two parties to identify similar users in their
  datasets without sharing their data. First, one party provides training data
  to create and configure an audience model, which is associated with a
  collaboration. Then, the second party brings their seed data to generate an
  audience that closely resembles the training data.
