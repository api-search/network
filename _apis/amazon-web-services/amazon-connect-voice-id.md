  Amazon Connect Voice ID is a cutting-edge feature within Amazon Connect
  that leverages machine learning technology to revolutionize caller
  authentication and fraud prevention in voice interactions. While
  traditional contact centers rely on time-consuming knowledge-based
  authentication methods, Voice ID uses the caller's unique voice
  characteristics to provide instant and accurate caller verification at a
  minimal cost.
