description: >-
  CodeArtifact is a managed artifact repository that supports various
  language-native package managers and build tools like npm, Apache Maven, pip,
  and dotnet. It allows teams to share and pull packages from both public and
  CodeArtifact repositories. Additionally, CodeArtifact enables the creation of
  upstream relationships between repositories, effectively combining their
  contents for package manager clients.
