  The Amazon Q in Connect API is an upgraded version of Amazon Connect
  Wisdom that utilizes generative AI to provide agents with suggested
  responses and actions to resolve customer inquiries quickly and enhance
  customer satisfaction. Instead of having knowledge articles, wikis, and
  FAQs scattered across various repositories, Amazon Q in Connect integrates
  them into one platform.
