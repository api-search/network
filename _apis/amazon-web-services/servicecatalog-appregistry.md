description: >-
  AWS Service Catalog enables IT administrators to create, manage, and
  distribute portfolios of approved products to end users, who can then access
  the products they need in a personalized portal. Typical products include
  servers, databases, websites, or applications that are deployed using AWS
  resources (for example, an Amazon EC2 instance or an Amazon RDS database).
