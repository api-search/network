  Amazon API Gateway is a powerful tool that enables developers to create and
  manage secure and scalable back ends for mobile and web applications. With API
  Gateway, developers can easily connect their applications to APIs running on
  Lambda, Amazon EC2, or other external web services. This ensures robust and
  reliable communication between applications and APIs, all within a secure
  environment.
