  AWS supports tagging on all core infrastructure resources that incur charges.
  Most other AWS resources also support tagging. Some resources support tagging
  only through that service's native tagging operations, and don't yet support
  this API. See the documentation for an individual service for information
  about that service's native tagging operations.
