  Amazon Managed Grafana is a managed and secure data visualization service
  that allows you to easily query, correlate, and visualize operational
  metrics, logs, and traces from various sources. It simplifies the
  deployment, operation, and scalability of Grafana, a popular data
  visualization tool known for its flexible data support. Users can create
  isolated Grafana servers, called workspaces, where they can design
  dashboards and visualizations to analyze their data without the need for
  hardware deployment.
