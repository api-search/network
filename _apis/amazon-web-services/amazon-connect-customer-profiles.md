  The Amazon Connect Customer Profiles API offers a centralized customer
  profile solution for contact centers, featuring pre-built connectors
  utilizing AppFlow technology. These connectors seamlessly integrate
  customer data from third-party applications like Salesforce, ServiceNow,
  and ERP systems with contact history from your Amazon Connect contact
  center. If you are a new user, the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide can
  assist you in familiarizing yourself with the platform.
