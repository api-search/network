  The Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB) Query API allows users to easily
  access multi-blockchain network data, enabling them to extract relevant
  information regarding blockchain activity. This API allows users to read
  data from public blockchain networks like Bitcoin Mainnet and Ethereum
  Mainnet, providing details such as current and historical balances of
  addresses, as well as a list of blockchain transactions within a specified
  time frame. Users can also retrieve specific transaction details,
  including transaction events, which can be further analyzed or
  incorporated into business logic for various applications.
