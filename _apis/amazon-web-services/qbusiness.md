description: >-
  Amazon Q generates code, tests, debugs, and has multistep planning and
  reasoning capabilities that can transform and implement new code generated
  from developer requests. Amazon Q also makes it easier for employees to get
  answers to questions across business data-such as company policies, product
  information, business results, code base, employees, and many other topics-by
  connecting to enterprise data repositories to summarize the data logically,
  analyze trends, and engage in dialogue about the data.
