  Amazon Athena is a user-friendly query service that allows you to analyze data
  stored in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. By pointing Athena to your data in S3,
  you can easily run ad-hoc queries and receive results within seconds. This
  serverless tool eliminates the need for infrastructure setup and management,
  as you only pay for the queries you execute. Athena is designed to scale
  automatically, executing queries in parallel to deliver fast results even with
  large datasets and complex queries.
