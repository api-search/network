  The AWS Marketplace Catalog API enables users to interact with their
  entities, such as products or offers on AWS Marketplace, by providing
  functionality for listing, describing, and updating them. By integrating
  the AWS Marketplace Catalog API with product build or deployment
  pipelines, users can streamline the process of updating entities.
