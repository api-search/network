description: |-

  This API, AWS IoT Greengrass, extends the capabilities of AWS to physical
  devices, enabling them to process data locally while still utilizing the
  cloud for management, analytics, and storage. This allows devices to
  respond quickly to local events even with intermittent connectivity,
  minimizing the cost of transmitting data to the cloud by enabling the
  execution of AWS Lambda functions locally.
