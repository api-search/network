  Amazon Web Services offers Amazon Verified Permissions, a comprehensive
  permissions management service for applications. By utilizing Verified
  Permissions, developers can control user access through authorization based on
  various factors such as user information, resource attributes, and requested
  actions. This service allows for the creation and storage of authorization
  policies using the Cedar policy language, supporting both role-based access
  control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) models.
