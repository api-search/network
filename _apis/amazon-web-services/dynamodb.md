description: >-
  Amazon DynamoDB, is a NoSQL database service that operates in a serverless
  environment, allowing you to build modern applications of any size. With
  DynamoDB, you only pay for the resources you use, and the database can scale
  down to zero, eliminating cold starts, version upgrades, maintenance windows,
  patching, and downtime.
