description: >-
  Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a managed, highly scalable, and
  reliable database service that is compatible with Apache Cassandra. This
  service makes it simple to migrate, operate, and expand Cassandra workloads
  within the Amazon Web Services Cloud environment. Users can easily create
  keyspaces and tables in Amazon Keyspaces with just a few clicks on the Amazon
  Web Services Management Console or through a few lines of code, without the
  need to set up any infrastructure or install software.
