  This API, Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), offers a platform for individuals
  and businesses to easily outsource tasks to a distributed workforce. These
  tasks can range from data validation and research to more subjective tasks
  like survey participation and content moderation. MTurk allows companies to
  leverage a global workforce to streamline processes, improve data collection
  and analysis, and enhance machine learning projects.
