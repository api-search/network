  The IoT Events API allows you to track the status and performance of your
  equipment or device fleets, enabling you to detect failures or changes in
  operation and take appropriate actions. With IoT Events Data API, you can
  interact with detectors by sending inputs, listing detectors, and accessing or
  modifying their status.
