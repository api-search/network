  Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a robust container
  management service provided by Amazon. It enables easy running, stopping,
  and management of Docker containers with high scalability and speed.
  Amazon ECS allows you to host your container clusters on a serverless
  infrastructure using Fargate or on Amazon EC2 instances that you manage.
  With Amazon ECS, you can effortlessly launch and stop container-based
  applications through simple API calls and benefit from centralized
  monitoring capabilities and familiar Amazon EC2 features. Additionally,
  Amazon ECS offers advanced scheduling capabilities for placing containers
  based on resource requirements, isolation policies, and availability
  needs. By using Amazon ECS, you can simplify cluster management,
  configuration, and scalability, eliminating the need for your own cluster
  and configuration management systems.
