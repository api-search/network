  AWS WAF Classic Regional is intended for developers who are implementing AWS
  WAF Classic with AWS resources such as Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
  Application Load Balancers and API Gateway APIs. For the most up-to-date
  version of AWS WAF, refer to the AWS WAFV2 API and Developer Guide, which now
  offers a unified set of endpoints for both regional and global use. The AWS
  WAF Regional Classic API Reference provides detailed information on AWS WAF
  Classic actions and data types for protecting ELB Application Load Balancers
  and API Gateway APIs. Developers can access these actions and data types
  through the listed endpoints in AWS Regions and Endpoints. This guide is
  designed to offer comprehensive information on API actions, data types, and
  errors for developers using AWS WAF Classic. Additional resources and detailed
  instructions on utilizing AWS WAF Classic can be found in the AWS WAF Classic
  developer guide.
