  Introducing the Clean Rooms API, designed for use with Amazon Web Services.
  This API allows multiple parties to securely collaborate and combine their
  data in a shared workspace. This collaborative environment enables members to
  query and receive insights from aggregated datasets without exposing raw data
  to other parties.
