  This API, Amazon AppFlow, allows for seamless automation of data flows
  between SaaS applications and AWS services with just a few clicks. You can
  run these data flows at your preferred frequency, whether on a schedule,
  in response to a business event, or on demand. Simplify data preparation
  through transformations, partitioning, and aggregation. Additionally,
  automate the preparation and registration of your schema with the AWS Glue
  Data Catalog for easy discovery and sharing of data with AWS analytics and
  machine learning services.
