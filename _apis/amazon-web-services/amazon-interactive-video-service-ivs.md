  The Amazon IVS API is a REST-compatible interface utilizing standard HTTP
  requests and an EventBridge event stream for responses. JSON format is
  used for both requests and responses, including error messages. This
  regional service is compatible with various Amazon IVS HTTPS endpoints
  across supported regions as detailed in the Amazon Web Services General
  Reference. API Request Parameters and URLs are case-sensitive. For a
  detailed account of documentation changes in each release, please refer to
