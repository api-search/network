  With AWS IoT Events, you can effortlessly monitor your equipment or device
  fleets for any failures or operational changes, and automatically trigger
  actions in response to these events. The API provides operations to manage
  inputs and detector models, including creating, reading, updating, and
  deleting them, as well as listing their versions.
