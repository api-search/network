  Savings Plans is a flexible pricing model that can help you reduce your
  bill by up to 72% compared to On-Demand prices, in exchange for a one- or
  three-year hourly spend commitment. AWS offers three types of Savings
  Plans: Compute Savings Plans, EC2 Instance Savings Plans, and Amazon
  SageMaker.
