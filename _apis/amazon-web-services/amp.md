description: >-
  The Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus API is a serverless monitoring
  service designed for container metrics. It allows users to securely monitor
  container environments at scale using the familiar open-source Prometheus data
  model and query language. This service provides improved scalability,
  availability, and security without the need to manage underlying
  infrastructure. The API includes both an Amazon Web Services API for managing
  resources such as workspaces, rule groups, and alert managers, as well as a
  Prometheus-compatible API for working within the Prometheus workspace.
