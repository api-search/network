  The Amazon WorkDocs API is tailored for a variety of use cases, including
  file migration, security applications, and eDiscovery/analytics. The API
  supports file migration applications for users looking to transfer files
  from different systems, while also allowing for basic metadata changes.
  Security applications can utilize the API actions to detect changes in
  WorkDocs and take necessary actions to ensure data security. General
  administrative applications, such as eDiscovery and analytics, can record
  and replicate data from WorkDocs for backup and analysis purposes.
