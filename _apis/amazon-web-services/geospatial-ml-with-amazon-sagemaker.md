description: |-

  Amazon SageMaker offers specialized machine learning features tailored for
  geospatial data analysis. With this API, users can easily create, train,
  and deploy ML models using geospatial data sources. Additionally, the API
  provides access to pre-built processing operations, pretrained ML models,
  and visualization tools, enabling users to run geospatial ML efficiently
  and on a large scale.
