description: |-

  EventBridge offers pre-defined schemas for events generated by AWS
  services, but you can also create custom schemas or infer them from events
  on an event bus. Once you have a schema, you can download code bindings
  for popular programming languages to accelerate development. You can
  manage schemas and work with code bindings from the EventBridge console,
  API, or directly in your IDE using AWS toolkits.
