description: |-

  With AWS CloudTrail, you can monitor your AWS deployments in the cloud by
  getting a history of AWS API calls for your account, including API calls
  made by using the AWS Management Console, the AWS SDKs, the command line
  tools, and higher-level AWS services. You can also identify which users
  and accounts called AWS APIs for services that support CloudTrail, the
  source IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls
  occurred.
