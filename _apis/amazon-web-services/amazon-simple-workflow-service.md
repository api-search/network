  The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) simplifies the process of
  building cloud-based applications that require coordination between
  distributed components. Tasks in Amazon SWF represent individual units of
  work within a workflow, with the service handling the management of
  intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency to maintain the
  logical flow of the application.
