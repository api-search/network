  AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that
  compiles source code, runs tests, and produces ready-to-deploy software
  packages. With CodeBuild, you don't need to provision, manage, and scale
  your own build servers. You just specify the location of your source code
  and choose your build settings, and CodeBuild will run your build scripts
  for compiling, testing, and packaging your code.
