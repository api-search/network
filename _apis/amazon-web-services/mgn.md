description: >-
  The AWS Application Migration Service streamlines the migration of your source
  servers to run directly on AWS, reducing the need for manual processes that
  are time-consuming and prone to errors. It also offers convenient optimization
  options for modernizing your applications, both through pre-built
  configurations and custom settings.
