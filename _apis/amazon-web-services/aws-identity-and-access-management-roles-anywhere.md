  The API for Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere enables secure
  access for workloads running outside of Amazon Web Services to obtain
  temporary AWS credentials. By leveraging IAM policies and roles, workloads
  can access AWS resources without the need for long-term credentials
  management.
