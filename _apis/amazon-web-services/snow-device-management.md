  The AWS Snow Family helps customers who need to run operations in austere,
  non-data center environments, and in locations which lack consistent network
  connectivity. The Snow Family (comprised of AWS Snowcone, Snowball, and AWS
  Snowmobile) offers a number of physical devices and capacity profiles, most
  with built-in computing capabilities.
