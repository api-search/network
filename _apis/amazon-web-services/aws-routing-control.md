  Welcome to the API Reference Guide for the Routing Control (Recovery
  Cluster) feature in Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller (ARC).
  With Route 53 ARC, you can utilize routing control to recover applications
  by redirecting traffic across different Availability Zones or Amazon Web
  Services Regions with high reliability. Routing controls act as simple
  on/off switches hosted on a highly available cluster within Route 53 ARC.
