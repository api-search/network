description: >-
  Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a fully managed service
  designed to simplify the process of running Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services.
  With Amazon EKS, users can easily deploy, scale, and manage containerized
  applications without the need to set up or maintain their own Kubernetes
  control plane.
