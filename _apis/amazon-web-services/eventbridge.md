description: >-
  With Amazon EventBridge, you can easily monitor and respond to changes in your
  AWS resources by setting up rules that trigger actions based on specific
  events. Events generated by your resources are sent to an event stream,
  allowing you to create customized rules that match certain events and direct
  them to designated targets for further processing. You can also schedule
  actions to be performed at specific intervals. For example, you can automate
  tasks such as updating DNS entries, analyzing API records for security risks,
  or creating snapshots of EBS volumes.
