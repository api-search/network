  The Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor API is a fully managed service that
  allows you to customize your billing data each month for accurate showback or
  chargeback to your end customers. It does not alter the way you are billed by
  AWS, but rather enables you to configure, generate, and display rates for
  specific customers during a billing period. You can also compare the rates you
  set to your actual AWS rates. With the API, payer accounts can view custom
  rates on the billing details page or set up cost and usage reports per billing
  group.
