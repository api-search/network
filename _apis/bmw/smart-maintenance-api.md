  The BMW Smart Maintenance API is a tool developed by BMW that utilizes
  advanced vehicle diagnostic technology to provide real-time information about
  the health and maintenance needs of a BMW vehicle. By connecting to the
  vehicle's onboard computer system, the API can monitor various aspects such as
  engine performance, tire pressure, and overall vehicle condition. This data is
  then used to generate personalized maintenance recommendations, such as when
  to schedule service appointments or replace certain parts. Additionally, the
  API can send alerts and notifications to users when issues or potential
  problems are detected, allowing for prompt action to be taken to ensure the
  vehicle remains in top condition. Overall, the BMW Smart Maintenance API aims
  to improve the overall driving experience by making vehicle maintenance more
  convenient, efficient, and proactive.
