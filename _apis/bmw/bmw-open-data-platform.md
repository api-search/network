  The BMW Open Data Platform is a digital initiative that provides developers,
  researchers, and innovators with access to a wide range of data related to BMW
  vehicles and mobility services. This platform allows users to access and
  analyze real-time vehicle data, including performance metrics, sensor data,
  and diagnostic information, in order to develop new applications, services,
  and technologies that can enhance the driving experience and improve overall
  vehicle performance. By opening up their data to external parties, BMW is
  fostering collaboration and innovation within the automotive industry, and
  empowering developers to create cutting-edge solutions that can benefit both
  BMW customers and the broader community.
