  and payment details. This technology enables customers to easily and safely
  integrate their banking data into different platforms, such as budgeting apps,
  financial management tools, and personal finance dashboards. The Barclays
  Consent API enhances the customer experience by enabling seamless and
  convenient data sharing while ensuring data security and privacy.
