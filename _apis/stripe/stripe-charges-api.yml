name: Stripe Charges API
description: >-
  The Charge object represents a single attempt to move money into your Stripe
  account. PaymentIntent confirmation is the most common way to create Charges,
  but transferring money to a different Stripe account through Connect also
  creates Charges. Some legacy payment flows create Charges directly, which is
  not recommended for new integrations.
