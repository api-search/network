  Products describe the specific goods or services you offer to your customers.
  For example, you might offer a Standard and Premium version of your goods or
  service; each version would be a separate Product. They can be used in
  conjunction with Prices to configure pricing in Payment Links, Checkout, and
  Subscriptions.
