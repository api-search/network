  Stripe supports processing charges in 135+ currencies allowing you to present
  prices in a customer's native currency. Doing so can improve sales and help
  customers avoid conversion costs. In order to present prices in your
  customer's currency, you need to specify the presentment currency when
  creating a PaymentIntent or a charge.
