description: >-
  Stripe Treasury is a banking-as-a-service API that lets you embed financial
  services in your product. With Stripe's API, you can enable businesses to hold
  funds, pay bills, earn yield, and manage their cash flow. Many users build
  Stripe Issuing in conjunction with Stripe Treasury to attach cards to spend
  funds in the account.
