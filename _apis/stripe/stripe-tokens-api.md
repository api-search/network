description: >-
  Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank
  account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from
  your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is
  returned to your server to use. Use our recommended payments integrations to
  perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive
  card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a
  PCI-compliant way.
