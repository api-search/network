description: >-
  The DistillerSR API documentation is designed for technical users to learn how
  various features in Distiller can be interacted with via the API for use with
  automated scripts, and leveraged in projects outside of DistillerSR.
  DistillerSR allows users to perform systematic reviews by importing references
  from various sources (like PubMed, EBSCO, etc.), reviewing references, and
  generating reports containing reviewer response sets, extracted data, and
  other statistics.
