  FHIR is a platform specification that defines a set of capabilities for use
  across the healthcare process, in all jurisdictions, and in lots of different
  contexts. While the basics of the FHIR specification are relatively
  straight-forward (see the Overviews: General, Developers, Clinical, and
  Architects), it can still be difficult to know where to start when
  implementing a solution based on FHIR.
