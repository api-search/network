  At Lightning Labs, we develop software that powers the Lightning Network. Our
  open source, secure, and scalable Lightning systems enable users to send and
  receive money more efficiently than ever before. We also offer a series of
  verifiable, non-custodial Lightning-based financial services. We bridge the
  world of open source software and the next-generation of bitcoin financial
  software.
