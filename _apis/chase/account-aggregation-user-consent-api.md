  The Account Aggregation User Consent API is a tool designed to streamline and
  simplify the process of obtaining user consent for accessing and aggregating
  financial information from multiple accounts. This API enables developers to
  seamlessly integrate consent management functionalities into their
  applications, allowing users to grant permission for their financial data to
  be accessed and shared with third-party services securely and efficiently. By
  providing a standardized approach to managing user consent, this API helps
  enhance trust, transparency, and compliance in the account aggregation
  process, ultimately enabling a more seamless and user-friendly experience for
  both developers and end-users.
