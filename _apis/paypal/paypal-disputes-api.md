  The Paypal Disputes API is a tool provided by Paypal that allows users to
  manage and resolve disputes related to transactions made through their
  platform. With this API, users can retrieve and update information about
  disputes, such as status, evidence, and comments. Users can also respond to
  disputes, provide evidence or information to support their case, and
  communicate with the other party involved in the dispute. This API streamlines
  the process of managing disputes, making it easier for users to resolve issues
  quickly and efficiently, ultimately leading to a better user experience for
  both buyers and sellers.
