  The Paypal Invoicing API allows merchants to create and send invoices to
  customers directly through their Paypal accounts. This API streamlines the
  invoicing process by automatically generating professional-looking invoices
  and tracking payment statuses in real time. Merchants can easily customize
  invoices with their branding and payment terms, as well as send reminders for
  overdue payments. Customers can securely pay invoices online using their
  Paypal accounts, credit cards, or bank transfers. The Paypal Invoicing API
  simplifies the payment process for both merchants and customers, improving
  efficiency and reducing manual work associated with invoicing.
