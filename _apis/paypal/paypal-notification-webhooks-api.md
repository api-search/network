  The Paypal Notification Webhooks API allows developers to receive real-time
  notifications about various events related to Paypal transactions on their
  platform. This API enables developers to subscribe to specific events, such as
  payments, refunds, or disputes, and receive instant notifications when these
  events occur. By leveraging webhooks, developers can ensure that they are
  promptly informed of any important activities on their Paypal account,
  allowing them to take immediate action if necessary. This API helps streamline
  communication between Paypal and developers, ensuring that they are always up
  to date with the latest transaction activity.
