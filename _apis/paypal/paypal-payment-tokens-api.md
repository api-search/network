  The Paypal Payment Tokens API is a platform that allows businesses to securely
  store and manage customer payment information in the form of tokens. These
  tokens act as a substitute for sensitive financial data such as credit card
  numbers, providing an extra layer of security for online transactions. By
  using this API, businesses can process payments more efficiently and securely,
  while also reducing the risk of exposing customer financial information to
  potential threats. Additionally, the Paypal Payment Tokens API enables
  businesses to create a seamless and convenient checkout experience for
  customers, ultimately enhancing their overall shopping experience.
