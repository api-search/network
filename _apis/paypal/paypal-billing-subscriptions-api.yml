  You can use billing plans and subscriptions to create subscriptions that
  process recurring PayPal payments for physical or digital goods, or services.
  A plan includes pricing and billing cycle information that defines the amount
  and frequency of charge for a subscription. You can also define a fixed plan,
  such as a $5 basic plan or a volume- or graduated-based plan with pricing
  tiers based on the quantity purchased. For more information, see <a
  href=\"/docs/subscriptions/\">Subscriptions Overview</a>.
