  openFDA is an Elasticsearch-based API that serves public FDA data about
  nouns like drugs, devices, and foods. Each of these nouns has one or more
  categories, which serve unique data-such as data about recall enforcement
  reports, or about adverse events. Every query to the API must go through
  one endpoint for one kind of data.
