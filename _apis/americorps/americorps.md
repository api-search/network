  AmeriCorps is a federal program in the United States that engages individuals
  in public service to address critical community needs, such as education,
  disaster response, environmental conservation, and poverty alleviation.
  Established in 1993, it operates under the Corporation for National and
  Community Service (CNCS), offering opportunities for participants, known as
  AmeriCorps members, to work with nonprofits, schools, and community
  organizations. Members commit to a term of service, during which they receive
  a stipend, professional development, and an education award that can be used
  to pay for college or repay student loans. AmeriCorps fosters civic engagement
  and aims to strengthen communities through volunteerism and capacity building.
