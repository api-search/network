  Road Safety HotspotsFor Mercedes-Benz, as an innovation leader in the field of
  safety and driver assistance systems, Vision 0 is part of the companys DNA.
  With data from the Mercedes-Benz assistance systems we identify, analyze, and
  display critical safety hotspots in the street network helping to take the
  right actions. Based on high quality data from our ADAS sensors in the
  customer fleet, we generate a risk model that indicates safety critical
  situations and near-misses in traffic.
