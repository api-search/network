  Genomic data is considerably large, and computational biologists generally
  need all the data that is available for their analyses. Web APIs, as a
  technology, were designed for retrieving relatively small pieces of data,
  often from Javascript. Consequently, Web APIs may not be the best way to get
  data from the UCSC Genome Browser.
