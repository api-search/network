  The Atlassian Jira Screens API allows developers to customize and create new
  screens within the Jira software. Screens are an essential component of Jira,
  as they provide users with a clear and organized way to input data and
  interact with the system. With the Screens API, developers can design unique
  screens tailored to their specific project needs, customize fields, layouts,
  and workflows, and enhance the user experience within Jira. This API is
  particularly useful for teams looking to streamline their workflows, improve
  productivity, and optimize their project management processes within the Jira
  platform.
