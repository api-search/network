  The Atlassian Jira Groups API allows users to programmatically manage user
  groups within the Jira software. With this API, developers can create, read,
  update, and delete groups, as well as add or remove users from groups. This
  API also enables administrators to assign permissions and access levels to
  different groups, helping to organize and streamline user access and
  permissions within Jira. By leveraging the Groups API, organizations can
  automate group management processes, enhance security measures, and ensure
  that users have the appropriate level of access to Jira resources.
