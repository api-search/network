  define and customize classification levels within their Jira software. These
  classification levels can be used to categorize issues, projects, or other
  aspects of their workflow based on specific criteria. By utilizing this API,
  users can create a structured hierarchy of classification levels that can help
  organize and prioritize their tasks more effectively. This can also streamline
  communication and collaboration among team members, as everyone will have a
  clear understanding of how different items are classified within the system.

  functionality and usability of Jira by providing users with a powerful tool
  for organizing and managing their work.
