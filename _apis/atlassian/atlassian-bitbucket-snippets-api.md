description: >-
  Snippets allow you share code segments or files with yourself, members of your
  workspace, or the world. Like pull requests, repositories and workspaces, the
  full set of snippets is defined by what the current user has access to. This
  includes all snippets owned by any of the workspaces the user is a member of,
  or snippets by other users that the current user is either watching or has
  collaborated on (for instance by commenting on it).
