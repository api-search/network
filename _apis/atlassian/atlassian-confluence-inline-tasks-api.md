  The Atlassian Confluence Inline Tasks API allows users to create, manage, and
  track tasks directly within Confluence pages. With this API, users can easily
  add tasks to their documents, specify due dates, assign tasks to specific team
  members, and mark tasks as completed. This functionality helps teams stay
  organized and on track by providing a centralized location for task management
  within Confluence. Additionally, the API allows for automation and integration
  with other tools, providing a seamless workflow for task management within the
  Confluence platform.
