  The Atlassian Jira Permissions API is a tool that allows users to manage and
  control permissions within the Jira software in a more efficient and
  customizable way. With this API, administrators can grant or revoke specific
  permissions for different users or user groups, ensuring that only authorized
  individuals have access to certain features or functionalities within Jira.
  This API also enables users to create custom permission schemes tailored to
  their organization's specific needs, providing a higher level of security and
  control over who can view, edit, or delete various resources and projects
  within Jira. Ultimately, the Jira Permissions API helps streamline the
  permissions management process and enhances overall data security within the
  Jira platform.
