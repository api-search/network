  The Atlassian Jira License API is a tool that allows organizations to manage
  their Jira software licenses programmatically. This API can be used to
  retrieve information about current licenses, update license details, and renew
  or extend existing licenses. By integrating the License API into their
  workflow, organizations can ensure that their Jira software is properly
  licensed and up-to-date, helping them stay compliant with licensing
  regulations and avoiding any potential legal issues. Additionally, the License
  API provides a convenient way for organizations to track and manage their Jira
  license usage across multiple teams and projects. Ultimately, the Atlassian
  Jira License API streamlines the licensing process and provides organizations
  with greater control and visibility over their Jira software licenses.
