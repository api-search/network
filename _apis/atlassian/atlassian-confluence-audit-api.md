description: >-
  The Atlassian Confluence Audit API provides developers and system
  administrators with a comprehensive set of tools to track and monitor user
  activity within their Confluence instance. This API allows users to view
  detailed logs of actions such as page creation, editing, and deletion, as well
  as user login and logout events. By utilizing the Confluence Audit API,
  organizations can ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, track usage
  patterns, and identify any unusual or unauthorized activity within their
  Confluence environment. These audit logs can also be used for forensic
  analysis and troubleshooting purposes, helping to maintain the security and
  integrity of the Confluence platform.
