  The Atlassian Jira Issue Type Scheme API is a tool that allows users to manage
  and customize issue type schemes within their Jira projects. This API enables
  users to create, update, and delete issue type schemes, as well as assign and
  configure issue types within these schemes. By using the Issue Type Scheme
  API, users can easily tailor their Jira projects to meet the specific needs
  and requirements of their team or organization. This API provides a flexible
  and intuitive way to organize and categorize issues, making it easier to track
  and manage project progress effectively.
