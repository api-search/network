  Connect is a development framework for extending Atlassian cloud products.
  Connect gives you control over the tech stack, infrastructure, and integration
  with Atlassian Cloud products. You determine your security implementation and
  authentication with external cloud providers, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or
  Heroku. It handles discovery, installation, authentication, and seamless
  integration into the user interface.
