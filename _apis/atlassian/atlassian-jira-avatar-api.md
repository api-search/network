  The Atlassian Jira Avatar API allows developers to programmatically manage and
  display user avatars within the Jira platform. This API enables users to
  access and update their profile pictures, as well as retrieve avatar images
  for other users within the system. By integrating this API into their
  applications, developers can create a more personalized and visually engaging
  user experience for Jira users. Additionally, the Avatar API helps streamline
  workflows by providing a simple and efficient way to manage user avatars
  across different Jira instances.
