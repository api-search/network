  The Atlassian Jira Workflow API provide developers with a way to interact with
  and manipulate Jira workflows programmatically. This API enables users to
  create, update, and delete workflow schemes, statuses, transitions, and other
  elements within Jira. Developers can use the Workflow API to automate
  repetitive tasks, integrate Jira workflows with other systems, and customize
  workflows to fit their specific business processes. With this API, users have
  more control and flexibility over how their workflows are configured and
  managed in Jira, ultimately improving productivity and efficiency in their
  development processes.
