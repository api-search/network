  ones, and make changes to the layout and design of Jira to suit their specific
  needs. With the UI Modifications API, users can improve the user experience,
  streamline workflows, and add new functionality to Jira, ultimately enhancing
  productivity and collaboration within their teams. Whether it's adding new
  buttons, widgets, or visual elements, the UI Modifications API empowers users
  to tailor Jira to their unique requirements, creating a more intuitive and
  efficient platform for managing projects and tasks.
