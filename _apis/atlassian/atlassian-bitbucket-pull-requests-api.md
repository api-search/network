  The Atlassian BitBucket Pull Requests API allows users to interact with pull
  requests in their repositories, providing a way to view, create, update, and
  merge pull requests. This API enables developers to programmatically manage
  code reviews and collaborate on code changes by providing endpoints for
  accessing pull request details, listing pull requests, creating new pull
  requests, and merging changes. By using the Pull Requests API, developers can
  streamline their workflow and automate processes related to code reviews and
  collaboration, ultimately improving the efficiency and quality of their code
  development.
