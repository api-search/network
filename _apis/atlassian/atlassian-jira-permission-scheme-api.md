  The Atlassian Jira Permission Scheme API is a powerful tool that allows users
  to customize and manage permission schemes within the Jira software platform.
  With this API, users can create, assign, update, and delete permission schemes
  to control who has access to specific features and functionalities within
  their Jira projects. This API enables users to define granular permission
  settings for different user groups, roles, and project types, ensuring that
  only authorized individuals have the appropriate level of access to
  confidential information and critical project resources. Through the Atlassian
  Jira Permission Scheme API, users can streamline the process of managing
  permissions, improve security controls, and enhance collaboration among team
  members working on Jira projects.
