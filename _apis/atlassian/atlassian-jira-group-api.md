  process of managing user access and permissions, ensuring that the right
  people have the right level of access to the necessary information. By
  utilizing this API, developers can easily automate group management tasks,
  saving time and reducing the potential for errors. Ultimately, the Atlassian
  Jira Group API helps to enhance collaboration, streamline workflows, and
