  The Atlassian Jira Label API is a tool that allows users to manage and
  manipulate labels within Jira software. Labels are keywords or tags that can
  be applied to issues, projects, or any other type of content within Jira. The
  Label API enables users to create, update, and delete labels, as well as
  retrieve information about existing labels. This allows for better
  organization and categorization of content within Jira, making it easier for
  users to find and track relevant information. Additionally, labels can be used
  to filter and search for specific content, helping teams to streamline their
  workflows and collaborate more efficiently.
