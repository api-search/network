  The Atlassian Jira Field Configuration API is a tool that allows users to
  customize and manage the fields within their Jira projects. With this API,
  users can create, update, or delete custom fields, as well as configure how
  these fields behave and are displayed within their projects. This level of
  customization allows users to tailor their Jira instance to their specific
  needs and workflows, ensuring that they can track and manage their projects in
  a way that is most beneficial to their team. Additionally, the Field
  Configuration API helps to streamline and optimize the user experience within
  Jira, making it easier for teams to collaborate and effectively manage their
  work.
