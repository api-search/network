  The Atlassian Jira Filter API allows users to programmatically create, manage,
  and retrieve filters within Jira software. Filters are used to define criteria
  for displaying specific sets of issues, such as those assigned to a particular
  user or with a certain status. With the Filter API, developers can automate
  the process of creating and modifying filters, as well as fetching filtered
  issue data to be used in other applications or integrations. This API provides
  users with the flexibility to customize their Jira experience and streamline
  their workflow by efficiently managing and accessing filtered issue
  information.
