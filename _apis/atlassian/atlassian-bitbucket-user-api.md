  The Atlassian BitBucket User API is a tool that allows developers to interact
  with and manage user accounts within the BitBucket platform. This API allows
  users to create, update, and delete user accounts, as well as retrieve
  information about those accounts. Developers can also use the User API to
  manage permissions and access levels for individual users, helping to ensure
  that only authorized individuals have access to specific resources within the
  BitBucket platform. Additionally, the User API can be used to automate user
  management tasks, such as adding users to specific groups or projects, making
  it easier for developers to streamline and simplify their workflows within
  BitBucket.
