  The Atlassian Jira Issues API allows developers to interact with and
  manipulate issues within Jira, a project management and issue tracking tool.
  With this API, users can create, update, delete, and search for issues, as
  well as perform various operations such as assigning issues to users, linking
  issues together, and adding attachments. The API provides a comprehensive set
  of endpoints that enable developers to automate processes, integrate Jira with
  other tools, and build custom solutions tailored to their specific needs. By
  leveraging the Jira Issues API, users can streamline their project management
  workflows and improve collaboration across teams.
