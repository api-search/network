  The Atlassian Jira Issue Link API is a tool that allows developers to create
  and manage links between different issues within a Jira instance. This API
  enables users to establish relationships between issues, such as dependencies,
  blocks, or relates to, making it easier to track and manage complex projects.
  With the Issue Link API, developers can programmatically create, update, and
  delete issue links, providing a seamless way to connect related tasks and keep
  teams organized and focused on project goals. Additionally, this API can help
  streamline communication and collaboration among team members by providing a
  centralized platform for tracking and discussing project progress.
