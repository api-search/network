  The Atlassian Jira Security Level API allows users to manage security levels
  within their Jira projects. Security levels in Jira help to control who can
  view or edit particular issues, ensuring that sensitive information is
  protected. With this API, users can create, delete, and update security
  levels, assign them to specific issues, and retrieve information about
  existing security levels. By using the Security Level API, organizations can
  customize levels of access to their Jira projects, providing an additional
  layer of security and control over their data.
