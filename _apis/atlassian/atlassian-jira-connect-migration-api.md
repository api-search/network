  Atlassian Jira Connect Migration API is a tool designed to seamlessly transfer
  data and configurations from one Jira Cloud instance to another. This API
  allows users to migrate their projects, issues, users, and other relevant data
  between Jira instances in a quick and efficient manner. By leveraging this
  API, organizations can easily consolidate multiple Jira instances, upgrade to
  new versions, or move their data to a different environment while minimizing
  downtime and ensuring data integrity. The Jira Connect Migration API
  simplifies the migration process, making it easier for teams to effectively
  manage their projects and collaborate efficiently across different Jira
  instances.
