description: >-
  This Atlassian Connect feature provide a mechanism for apps to signal
  readiness for new API behaviors as well as selectively enrol during the
  introduction / deprecation period for the purposes of testing. Development of
  this mechanism was motivated by the introduction of API changes that are not
  backward compatible (e.g. the removal of legacy user references from our
  public cloud REST APIs). Such changes will break existing apps that do not yet
  support the new API version.
