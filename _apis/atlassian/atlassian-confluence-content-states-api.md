  The Atlassian Confluence Content States API is a tool designed to help users
  manage and track changes to content within the Confluence platform. This API
  allows users to view the current state of content, such as whether it is in
  draft form, published, or archived, and make updates as needed. By using the
  Content States API, users can easily track the progress of their content,
  collaborate with team members, and ensure that all information is up to date
  and accurate. This tool is integral for maintaining an organized and efficient
  workflow within Confluence, making it easier for users to manage and track
  their content effectively.
