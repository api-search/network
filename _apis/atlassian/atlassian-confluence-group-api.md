  The Atlassian Confluence Group API is a tool that allows users to manage and
  interact with groups within the Confluence platform. With this API,
  administrators can create, modify, and delete groups, as well as add or remove
  users from these groups. It provides a seamless way to organize and control
  access to content, ensuring that only authorized users are able to view or
  edit specific pages. The Atlassian Confluence Group API streamlines the group
  management process, making it easier for administrators to maintain a secure
  and organized workspace for their team.
