  The Atlassian Jira Field Configuration Scheme API is a tool that allows users
  to define how and where custom fields appear in Jira issues. By using this
  API, administrators can create and configure field configuration schemes that
  determine which custom fields are available in different issue screens, such
  as create, edit, and view screens. This provides a flexible way to customize
  the fields that users see and interact with when working on Jira issues,
  allowing for better organization and visibility of important information.
  Additionally, the API enables administrators to easily manage field
  configurations across multiple projects and issue types, streamlining the
  process of setting up and maintaining custom fields in Jira.
