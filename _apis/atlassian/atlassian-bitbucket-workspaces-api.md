  The Atlassian BitBucket Workspaces API is a powerful tool that allows users to
  manage and interact with multiple projects within their BitBucket account.
  With this API, users can create, update, and delete workspaces, as well as
  manage permissions and settings for each workspace. Additionally, the API
  enables users to create and manage repositories within their workspaces,
  facilitating collaboration and efficient project management. By providing a
  comprehensive set of endpoints and functionalities, the BitBucket Workspaces
  API streamlines the process of organizing and coordinating projects,
  ultimately enhancing productivity and collaboration within development teams.
