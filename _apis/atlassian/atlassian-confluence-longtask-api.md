  The Atlassian Confluence Longtask API is a tool that allows users to create
  and manage long-running tasks within the Confluence platform. This API enables
  users to track the progress of complex tasks, such as data processing, batch
  operations, or report generation, by providing status updates, error handling,
  and notifications. With the Longtask API, users can set up paged results,
  cancel and restart tasks, and define custom timeout options to ensure
  efficient task management. By integrating this API into their workflows, teams
  can streamline their processes, improve productivity, and ensure the
  successful completion of time-consuming tasks in Confluence.
