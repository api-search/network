  The Atlassian Jira Resolution API provides developers with a way to access and
  manage resolution information for issues within the Jira software development
  platform. This API allows users to retrieve a list of available resolutions,
  create new resolutions, update existing resolutions, and delete resolutions as
  needed. By interacting with the Resolution API, developers can easily
  customize and automate the resolution process for issues in their Jira
  projects, streamlining workflow and improving overall efficiency.
  Additionally, this API enables seamless integration with other tools and
  systems, providing a comprehensive solution for issue resolution management
  within the Jira platform.
