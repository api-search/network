  The Atlassian Confluence Label API is a tool that allows users to
  programmatically manage labels within their Confluence pages. Labels are
  keywords or tags that can be added to pages to categorize and organize
  content. With the Label API, users can add, remove, or update labels on pages,
  as well as retrieve information about which labels are applied to a specific
  page. This API simplifies the process of managing labels, making it easier for
  users to organize and find content within their Confluence spaces.
