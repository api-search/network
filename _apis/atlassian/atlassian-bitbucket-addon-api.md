  The Atlassian BitBucket Addon API is a tool that allows developers to create
  custom add-ons and integrations for the BitBucket platform. With this API,
  developers can extend the functionality of BitBucket by building new features,
  tools, and services that enhance the user experience. By leveraging the Addon
  API, developers can create seamless integrations with other tools and
  services, automate repetitive tasks, and streamline workflows within the
  BitBucket platform. This API provides developers with the flexibility and
  control to customize their BitBucket experience and create tailored solutions
  that meet their specific needs.
