  The Atlassian Jira Issue Type Screen Scheme API is a tool that allows users to
  customize the screens that are displayed for different issue types in their
  Jira project. With this API, users can create and manage screen schemes that
  define which screens are associated with each issue type in their project.
  This allows users to tailor the user interface to best suit the needs of their
  team and project, ensuring that the necessary information is easily accessible
  and properly organized. The API provides a flexible and customizable way to
  optimize the user experience within Jira and improve workflow efficiency.
