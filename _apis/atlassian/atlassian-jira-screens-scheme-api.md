  The Atlassian Jira Screens Scheme API allows users to customize and configure
  their Jira screens by defining different screen schemes. These screen schemes
  control which screens are used by default for different issue operations, such
  as creating, editing, and transitioning issues. By using this API, users can
  create custom screen schemes that are tailored to their specific project or
  team needs. This can help improve team efficiency and streamline workflows by
  ensuring that the right information is captured and displayed at the right
  time during issue management within Jira. Additionally, the API can be used to
  automate screen scheme configurations and ensure consistency across multiple
  projects or teams within an organization. Overall, the Atlassian Jira Screens
  Scheme API provides a flexible and powerful way to manage and customize
  screens in Jira to meet the unique requirements of any project or team.
