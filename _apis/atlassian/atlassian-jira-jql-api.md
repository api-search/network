  The Atlassian Jira Jql API is a powerful tool that allows users to query and
  manipulate their Jira data with ease. By using Jira Query Language (JQL),
  users can create complex queries to filter, search, and retrieve specific
  issues or data from their Jira instance. The API provides developers with the
  ability to programmatically access and interact with Jira data, enabling them
  to automate processes, build custom integrations, and extract valuable
  insights from their Jira projects. With the Jira Jql API, users can unleash
  the full potential of their Jira instance, streamline workflows, and improve
  productivity within their teams.
