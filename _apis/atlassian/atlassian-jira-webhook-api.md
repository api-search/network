description: >-
  A webhook is a user-defined callback over HTTP. You can use Jira webhooks to
  notify your app or web application when certain events occur in Jira. For
  example, you might want to alert your remote application when an issue is
  updated or when sprint is started. Using a webhook to do this means that your
  remote application doesn't have to periodically poll Jira (via the REST APIs)
  to determine whether changes have occurred.
