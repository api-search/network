  This resource represents issue security schemes. Use it to get an issue
  security scheme or a list of issue security schemes. Issue security schemes
  control which users or groups of users can view an issue. When an issue
  security scheme is associated with a project, its security levels can be
  applied to issues in that project. Sub-tasks also inherit the security level
  of their parent issue.
