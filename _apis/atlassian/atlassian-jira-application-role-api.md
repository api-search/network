  The Atlassian Jira Application Role API is a tool that allows users to manage
  and control the roles within the Jira software application. This API provides
  functionalities for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving application
  roles. With the Application Role API, administrators can easily assign
  different roles to users based on their responsibilities and permissions
  within the system. This helps streamline the workflow and ensures that users
  have the appropriate access to the features and functions they need to perform
  their tasks efficiently. Additionally, the API allows for seamless integration
  with other software applications, providing a comprehensive solution for
  managing roles and permissions within the Jira ecosystem.
