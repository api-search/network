  The Atlassian Jira User API is a tool designed to manage and interact with
  user data within the Jira software development platform. This API allows users
  to access and update information related to user accounts, such as usernames,
  email addresses, and display names. It also provides functionality for
  creating and managing user groups, enabling administrators to organize and
  assign permissions to users more efficiently. Additionally, the API supports
  functions for retrieving user activity logs, tracking user actions, and
  auditing user permissions within Jira. By leveraging the Jira User API,
  organizations can streamline user management processes and enhance security
  measures within their Jira instance.
