  The Atlassian Jira Project API allows users to access and interact with their
  Jira projects programmatically. This API enables developers to create,
  retrieve, update, and delete projects, as well as manage project
  configurations, issues, boards, and workflows. With the Jira Project API,
  users can automate project management tasks, integrate Jira with other tools
  and systems, and build custom applications that leverage Jira project data.
  This powerful API provides a way for teams to streamline their project
  management processes and improve collaboration and productivity within their
  organization.
