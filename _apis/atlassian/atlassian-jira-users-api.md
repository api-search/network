  The Atlassian Jira Users API is a tool that allows developers to access and
  manage user data within the Jira software. With the Users API, developers can
  retrieve information about individual users, such as their username, email
  address, and profile picture. They can also create new users, update existing
  user data, and delete users as needed. This API is essential for integrating
  Jira with other systems and applications, as it provides a way to access and
  manipulate user information within the Jira environment. By utilizing the Jira
  Users API, developers can streamline user management processes and create a
  more seamless experience for both administrators and end-users.
