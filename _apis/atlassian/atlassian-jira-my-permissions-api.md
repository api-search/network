  The Atlassian Jira My Permissions API is a tool that allows users to manage
  and view their own permission levels within the Jira project management
  software. This API allows users to easily access information about their
  specific permissions, such as which projects they have access to, what level
  of access they have, and any restrictions or limitations that may be in place.
  With this API, users can quickly and efficiently navigate their permissions,
  ensuring that they have the appropriate level of access to carry out their
  work effectively within the Jira platform. This tool provides users with more
  control and visibility over their permissions, helping to streamline their
  workflow and productivity.
