  The Atlassian Jira Workflow Scheme API allows users to programmatically manage
  workflow schemes within their Jira instance. This API enables users to create,
  update, and delete workflow schemes, as well as associate workflows with
  different issue types. By interacting with this API, users can customize their
  workflows to better align with their team's specific processes and
  requirements. This helps to streamline workflow management and allow for more
  efficient issue tracking and resolution within Jira. Overall, the Jira
  Workflow Scheme API provides users with the flexibility and control to tailor
  their workflows to meet their unique needs.  So, in summary, one can use the
  API to better customize and manage workflow schemes within their Jira
  instance.
