description: >-
  This resource represents workflow schemes. Use it to manage workflow schemes
  and the workflow scheme's workflows and issue types. A workflow scheme maps
  issue types to workflows. A workflow scheme can be associated with one or more
  projects, which enables the projects to use the workflow-issue type mappings.
