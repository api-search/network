  The Atlassian Confluence User API is a powerful tool that allows developers to
  interact with user data within the Confluence platform. With this API,
  developers can create, read, update, and delete user information, such as
  usernames, email addresses, and profile details. This API provides a seamless
  way to manage user accounts, permissions, and settings in Confluence, making
  it easier for administrators to control access and permissions for users.
  Additionally, the Confluence User API allows developers to integrate user data
  with other systems and applications, facilitating seamless user management
  across multiple platforms.
