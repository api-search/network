  The Strava API is a tool that allows developers to access and interact with
  data from the popular fitness tracking app, Strava. This API enables
  third-party applications to retrieve information such as user activity,
  routes, segments, and leaderboard rankings. Developers can use this data to
  create features that enhance the user experience, improve training insights,
  and streamline data visualization. By integrating with the Strava API,
  developers can build innovative solutions that leverage the rich repository of
  fitness data collected by Strava users. Ultimately, the Strava API promotes
  collaboration, creativity, and customization within the fitness and wellness
  ecosystem.
