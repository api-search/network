  Greenhouse integrates with many candidate testing platforms, including code
  testing, video interviewing, personality testing, and more. Weve created the
  Assessment Partner API to allow our customers to seamlessly integrate our
  Partners assessments into their Greenhouse interview workflow. This document
  outlines the end-user experience with the integration and the technical
  details of how to implement it.
