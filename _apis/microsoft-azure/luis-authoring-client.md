  The Microsoft Azure Luis Authoring Client is a tool used for building and
  managing Language Understanding (LUIS) applications. LUIS is a cloud-based
  service that allows developers to create natural language understanding models
  to interpret user input and extract relevant information. With the Authoring
  Client, users can easily define intents and entities, train models, and test
  how well their application understands and processes different types of input.
  The tool provides a user-friendly interface for designing and fine-tuning
  language understanding models, making it easier for developers to create
  powerful and accurate conversational interfaces for their applications.
