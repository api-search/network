description: >-
  The Microsoft Azure Bicep Client is a tool that allows users to author and
  deploy infrastructure as code on the Azure cloud platform. It enables
  developers to define and manage Azure resources using a declarative syntax
  that is easier to read and write than traditional template languages like JSON
  or ARM templates. With Bicep, users can create reusable modules, parameterize
  their configurations, and validate their code for best practices and
  compliance. The Bicep Client simplifies the process of provisioning and
  managing cloud resources, making it easier for teams to collaborate and
  automate their infrastructure deployments.
