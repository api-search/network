  Microsoft Azure API for managing SCOM managed instances and monitored
  resources provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools and
  capabilities to efficiently manage System Center Operations Manager (SCOM)
  resources on the Azure platform. This API allows users to programmatically
  access and interact with SCOM managed instances, including creating, updating,
  and deleting resources, as well as retrieving information about monitored
  resources and triggering actions based on monitoring data. With this API,
  developers can streamline their management processes, automate routine tasks,
  and ensure the optimal performance and availability of their SCOM resources in
  the Azure environment.
