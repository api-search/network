  The Microsoft Azure Diagnostics API Client is a tool that allows users to
  retrieve diagnostic data from Azure services and resources. This includes
  information about the performance, availability, and usage of applications and
  virtual machines running in the Azure environment. The API client provides
  developers with the ability to monitor and analyze the health and status of
  their systems, as well as troubleshoot any issues that may arise. By accessing
  this valuable diagnostic data, users can gain insights into their
  application's behavior and performance, allowing them to make informed
  decisions to optimize and improve their Azure-based services.
