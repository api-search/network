  Microsoft Azure ExpressRouteCrossConnection REST APIs provide a way to manage
  cross-connections for Azure ExpressRoute. These APIs allow users to create,
  update, delete, and list express route cross-connections, as well as retrieve
  details about specific cross-connections. Users can also use these APIs to
  configure settings for cross-connections, such as bandwidth and peering
  locations. Additionally, the APIs enable users to monitor the status and
  health of their cross-connections, making it easier to troubleshoot issues and
  ensure optimal performance. Overall, these APIs streamline the process of
  managing express route cross-connections, giving users greater control and
  visibility over their network connectivity.
