  Microsoft Azure Ingestion Using Data Collection Rules is a feature that allows
  organizations to easily and efficiently ingest large amounts of data into
  their Azure environment. By creating data collection rules, users can specify
  how data should be collected, transformed, and stored, making the ingestion
  process more streamlined and automated. This feature not only helps
  organizations save time and resources but also ensures that data is ingested
  in a consistent and structured manner, making it easier to analyze and derive
  insights from. With Microsoft Azure Ingestion Using Data Collection Rules,
  organizations can effectively manage their data ingestion processes and make
  better use of their data assets.
