  Microsoft Azure Target Types allows users to define the specific targets they
  want to monitor and manage within their Azure environment. This feature
  provides a way to classify and organize different types of resources based on
  their function, location, or any other relevant criteria. By categorizing
  targets into specific groups, users can easily track and monitor the
  performance, usage, and configuration of these resources, making it easier to
  ensure that everything is running smoothly and efficiently. Additionally,
  Azure Target Types enable users to set up customized alerts and notifications
  for each target group, allowing them to proactively address any issues or
  potential problems that may arise within their Azure environment.
