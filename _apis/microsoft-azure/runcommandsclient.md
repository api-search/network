  Microsoft Azure Run Commands Client is a tool that allows users to remotely
  execute commands on virtual machines and cloud services running on the Azure
  platform. This client provides a secure and efficient way to manage and
  troubleshoot resources in the Azure environment without needing direct access

  scripts, install software, configure settings, and perform other maintenance
  tasks on Azure VMs. This tool simplifies the process of managing and
  maintaining resources in the cloud, making it easier for administrators to
  keep their systems running smoothly.
