  The Microsoft Azure Reservation API allows users to manage and optimize their
  cloud resources by enabling them to pre-purchase Azure services like virtual
  machines, databases, and storage for a specified period of time at a
  discounted rate. By making reservations in advance, users can ensure
  availability and capacity for their workloads while also saving costs compared
  to on-demand pricing. The API provides flexible options for creating,
  modifying, and canceling reservations, allowing users to easily adjust their
  resource allocations to meet changing business needs. Additionally, the
  Reservation API offers visibility into usage data and recommendations for
  optimizing reservations, helping users to efficiently utilize their cloud
  resources and maximize their investment in Azure services.
