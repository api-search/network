  Use these APIs to manage Visual Studio Team Services resources through the
  Azure Resource Manager. All task operations conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol
  specification and each operation returns an x-ms-request-id header that can be
  used to obtain information about the request. You must make sure that requests
  made to these resources are secure. For more information, see
