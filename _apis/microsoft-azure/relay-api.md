description: >-
  Microsoft Azure Relay API provides a secure way to establish communication
  between on-premises and cloud-based applications, enabling seamless data
  exchange and interaction between different environments. By acting as a bridge
  between the two, the Azure Relay API allows for real-time messaging and
  event-driven scenarios, making it easier for organizations to integrate their
  systems and services. This API also offers advanced security features such as
  message encryption and identity validation, ensuring that data is protected
  during transmission. In addition, Azure Relay API supports hybrid cloud
  solutions, allowing businesses to leverage the benefits of both on-premises
  and cloud environments without compromising security or performance.
