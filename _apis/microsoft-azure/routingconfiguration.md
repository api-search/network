  Microsoft Azure Routing Configuration allows users to define and manage routes
  for directing network traffic within their Azure virtual network. By setting
  up routing tables, users can control how traffic is routed between subnets,
  virtual networks, and external networks. This configuration enables users to
  ensure that network traffic is efficiently and securely directed to its
  intended destination. Additionally, Azure Routing Configuration provides
  visibility and control over network traffic flow, helping users optimize
  performance and troubleshoot any routing issues that may arise. Overall, this
  feature empowers users to effectively manage and control network routing
  within their Azure environment.
