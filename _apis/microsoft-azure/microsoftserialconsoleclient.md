  The Microsoft Azure Microsoft Serial Console Client is a tool that allows
  users to interact with virtual machines through a serial console connection.
  This feature is particularly useful when there are networking issues that
  prevent access to the VM through traditional methods. With the Serial Console
  Client, users can troubleshoot and diagnose issues directly from the Azure
  portal, regardless of the state of the VM. This tool provides a secure and
  reliable way to access VMs for troubleshooting and maintenance tasks, ensuring
  that users can quickly address any issues that may arise.
