description: >-
  The Microsoft Azure Microsoft Sentinel Upload Indicators API is a tool
  designed to allow users to quickly and easily upload indicators of compromise
  (IOCs) into their Azure Sentinel workspace. This API streamlines the process
  of sharing threat intelligence data, enabling organizations to better identify
  and respond to security threats in real-time. By automating the process of
  uploading IOCs, the API helps enhance the overall security posture of an
  organization and enables faster threat detection and response capabilities.
  Additionally, the API provides users with the ability to customize and
  fine-tune their threat intelligence feeds, further enhancing the effectiveness
  of their security operations.
