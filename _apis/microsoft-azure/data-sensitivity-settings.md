  Microsoft Azure Data Sensitivity Settings is a feature that allows users to
  classify and label their data based on its sensitivity level. By categorizing
  data as either public, confidential, or highly confidential, users can apply
  specific security measures and access controls to ensure that sensitive
  information is protected. These settings help organizations comply with
  regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA by enabling them to easily track and manage
  the flow of sensitive data within their Azure environment. Additionally, Data
  Sensitivity Settings provide valuable insights into how data is being handled
  and shared, allowing organizations to proactively identify and address
  potential security risks.
