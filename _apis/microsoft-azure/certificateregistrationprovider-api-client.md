  The Microsoft Azure Certificate Registration Provider API Client is a tool
  that allows users to securely manage and automate the provisioning and renewal
  of SSL/TLS certificates on their Azure resources. By integrating with Azure
  Key Vault, the API client enables users to easily upload, retrieve, and
  configure certificates for their web applications, virtual machines, and other
  cloud services. This streamlined process helps improve security and
  compliance, as well as simplifies certificate management for users deploying
  applications on the Azure platform. Additionally, the API client provides
  detailed logging and monitoring capabilities to track certificate usage and
  expiry dates, ensuring that all certificates are up-to-date and compliant with
  industry standards.
