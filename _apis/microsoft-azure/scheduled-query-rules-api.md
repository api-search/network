  The Microsoft Azure Scheduled Query Rules API allows users to create and
  manage scheduled query rules that monitor and analyze data for potential
  issues or anomalies. By defining specific query rules and setting a schedule
  for when they should be executed, users can proactively detect and address any
  issues in their Azure environment. This API enables users to customize queries
  based on their specific needs and receive alerts or notifications when certain
  conditions are met. With the Scheduled Query Rules API, users can improve the
  overall efficiency and performance of their Azure resources by identifying and
  resolving issues before they escalate.
