  Microsoft Azure Common Incident Types is a comprehensive monitoring and
  alerting system that helps users to identify and respond to common incidents
  that may occur within their Azure environment. This tool monitors critical
  systems and services, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and
  networking resources, to detect issues like performance degradation,
  connectivity issues, and resource limitations. By proactively monitoring these
  key components, Azure Common Incident Types helps users to quickly identify
  and mitigate potential problems before they escalate into larger issues that
  could impact their business operations. This allows users to maintain a high
  level of availability and reliability for their Azure-based applications and
  services.
