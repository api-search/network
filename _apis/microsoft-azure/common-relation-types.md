  Microsoft Azure Common Relation Types is a feature that allows users to
  establish relationships between different data entities in their Azure
  environment. These relationships can be defined in various ways, such as
  one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. With these relation types, users can
  easily connect and reference related data across different Azure services,
  making it easier to manage and analyze complex data structures. This feature
  helps users to create more cohesive and organized data models within their
  Azure environment, ultimately improving the efficiency and effectiveness of
  their data management processes.
