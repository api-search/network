  Microsoft Azure Common Entity Types is a tool that helps users easily access
  and manage different types of entities within the Azure environment. By
  categorizing entities based on common characteristics, such as virtual
  machines, databases, storage accounts, and networks, users can efficiently
  organize and navigate their resources. This tool allows users to quickly
  identify and interact with specific entities, streamlining the management and
  operation of their Azure deployments. Additionally, Microsoft Azure Common
  Entity Types provides a unified and consistent interface for users to monitor,
  analyze, and troubleshoot their entities, ultimately enhancing the overall
  efficiency and performance of their Azure applications.
