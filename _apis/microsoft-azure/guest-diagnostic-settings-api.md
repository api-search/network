  The Microsoft Azure Guest Diagnostic Settings API allows users to configure
  diagnostic settings for virtual machines running on the Azure platform. By
  using this API, users can specify which types of diagnostic data they want to
  collect, such as performance metrics, logs, or event traces. This data can
  then be sent to a storage account or event hub for analysis and monitoring.
  With the Guest Diagnostic Settings API, users can easily customize and manage
  the diagnostic information being collected from their virtual machines,
  helping them to troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and maintain the
  health and security of their Azure resources.
