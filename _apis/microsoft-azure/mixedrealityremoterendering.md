  Microsoft Azure Mixed Reality Remote Rendering allows users to create
  high-fidelity, immersive mixed reality experiences without the need for
  powerful local hardware. Through cloud-based rendering capabilities, users can
  offload the complex rendering processes to remote servers, enabling them to
  stream high-quality graphics and visuals directly to their mixed reality
  devices. This technology maximizes performance, enhances user experiences, and
  opens up new opportunities for creating cutting-edge mixed reality
  applications across various industries. With Azure Mixed Reality Remote
  Rendering, developers can easily scale their projects, collaborate in
  real-time, and deliver stunning mixed reality content to their audiences.
