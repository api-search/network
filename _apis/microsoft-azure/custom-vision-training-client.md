  images. The Training Client offers a user-friendly interface that guides users
  through the process of uploading data, labeling images, and training the
  model. This tool is particularly useful for companies or developers looking to
  create tailored image recognition solutions that meet their unique
  requirements. With the Custom Vision Training Client, users can easily build
  and deploy custom models that can improve the accuracy and efficiency of image
