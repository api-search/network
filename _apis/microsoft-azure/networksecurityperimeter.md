  Microsoft Azure Network Security Perimeter is a comprehensive solution that
  helps organizations protect their critical data and resources from cyber
  threats. It establishes a secure network perimeter by implementing various
  security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access
  controls. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to the network and ensures
  that only trusted users and devices can interact with the organization's
  systems. Azure Network Security Perimeter also provides advanced threat
  detection capabilities to identify and respond to potential security breaches
  quickly. Overall, this solution helps organizations strengthen their overall
  security posture and enhance the protection of their sensitive information.
