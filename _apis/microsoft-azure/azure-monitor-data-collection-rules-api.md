  The Microsoft Azure Monitor Data Collection Rules API allows users to define
  and configure rules that determine how data is collected and processed in
  their Azure monitor environment. By creating custom data collection rules,
  users can specify which data sources to collect from, how frequently data
  should be collected, and how it should be processed and stored. This API
  provides a flexible and powerful way to customize data collection to meet the
  specific monitoring needs of an organization, enabling users to tailor their
  monitoring solution to best suit their requirements and efficiently manage and
  analyze the data being collected.
