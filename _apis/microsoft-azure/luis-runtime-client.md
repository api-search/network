  The Microsoft Azure Luis Runtime Client is a software tool that enables
  developers to access and interact with the Language Understanding Intelligent
  Service (LUIS) in the Azure cloud platform. This client provides a seamless
  way for applications to leverage LUIS, a natural language processing service
  that helps understand user input and intents. With the Azure Luis Runtime
  Client, developers can easily integrate LUIS into their applications, allowing
  them to build intelligent and conversational interfaces that can accurately
  comprehend and respond to user queries and requests. The client streamlines
  the process of connecting to LUIS and provides the necessary functionality to
  process and interpret user input efficiently.
