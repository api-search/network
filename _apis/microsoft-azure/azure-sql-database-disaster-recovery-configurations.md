  Microsoft Azure SQL Database Disaster Recovery Configurations allow users to
  set up a failover environment in case of a disaster or outage. This includes
  configuring geo-replication to replicate data to a secondary region, setting
  up automatic failover to switch to the secondary region in case of an outage,
  and configuring point-in-time restore to recover data to a specific point in
  time. Additionally, users can set up alerts and monitoring to be notified of
  any issues and ensure the database is always available and secure. These
  configurations help ensure business continuity and minimize downtime in the
  event of a disaster.
