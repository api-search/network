  Microsoft Azure Network Manager Group Membership allows users to create and
  manage groups within their network to easily organize and assign permissions
  to different users. This feature streamlines the process of managing access
  control within the network by providing an intuitive interface for users to
  easily add or remove members from groups. By centralizing group membership
  management, administrators can ensure that users have the appropriate level of
  access to resources, helping to maintain security and streamline network
  operations. Additionally, Azure Network Manager Group Membership can help
  improve collaboration and productivity by enabling users to easily share
  resources with others in their group.
