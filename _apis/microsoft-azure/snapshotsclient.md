  The Microsoft Azure Snapshots Client is a tool that provides users with the
  ability to create and manage snapshots of virtual machines in the Azure cloud
  platform. Snapshots are essentially point-in-time copies of a virtual
  machine's disk that can be used for backup, disaster recovery, or testing
  purposes. With the Azure Snapshots Client, users can easily schedule, create,
  and delete snapshots, as well as restore a virtual machine to a previous state
  using a snapshot. This tool helps to ensure data protection and availability,
  allowing users to quickly and efficiently recover from any unplanned downtime
  or data loss. Overall, the Microsoft Azure Snapshots Client is a valuable tool
  for managing and safeguarding virtual machine data in the Azure cloud
  environment.
