  Microsoft Azure Private Accesses Types provides users with secure and private
  access to Azure resources. This feature allows organizations to control access
  to their resources, ensuring that only authorized users can connect to them.
  There are several types of private access methods available, including Azure
  Private Link, Virtual Network Service Endpoints, and Azure ExpressRoute. These
  options give users flexibility in how they enable private connectivity to
  their resources, whether it be through private IPs, virtual networks, or
  dedicated connections. By utilizing these access types, organizations can
  ensure that their data remains secure and protected from unauthorized access.
