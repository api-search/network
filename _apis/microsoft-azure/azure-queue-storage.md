description: >-
  Microsoft Azure Queue Storage is a cloud-based service that allows users to
  store large amounts of messages in a queue for later processing. This service
  provides reliable and scalable message delivery for applications that need to
  decouple their components and scale independently. Azure Queue Storage can be
  used for tasks such as queuing up work items, passing messages between
  components, or handling asynchronous communication between different parts of
  an application. Messages are stored in a queue until they are retrieved and
  processed, making it an efficient way to manage and distribute workloads in a
  distributed system. Overall, Microsoft Azure Queue Storage helps improve the
  performance, scalability, and reliability of cloud-based applications.
