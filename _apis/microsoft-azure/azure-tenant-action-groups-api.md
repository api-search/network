description: >-
  The Microsoft Azure Tenant Action Groups API allows users to programmatically
  manage and configure action groups within their Azure tenant. Action groups
  are collections of notification preferences and actions that can be triggered
  in response to alerts and events in Azure Monitor. With this API, users can
  create, update, and delete action groups, as well as configure the specific
  notifications and actions to be taken when a particular event occurs. This API
  provides a flexible and customizable way for users to define their alert
  response workflows and ensure that they are promptly notified and can take
  appropriate action when issues arise in their Azure environment.
