  Microsoft Azure SQL Database Server Firewall Rules allow users to control
  access to their Azure SQL databases by defining rules that specify the IP
  addresses or IP address ranges that are allowed to connect to the server. This
  feature adds an additional layer of security to the database server by
  restricting access to only trusted sources. Users can create, modify, and
  delete firewall rules as needed to ensure that only authorized users are able
  to connect to the database server. Additionally, the firewall rules can be
  configured to allow connections from specific Azure services or resources,
  providing even more granular control over access to the database server.
  Overall, Azure SQL Database Server Firewall Rules help users protect their
  data and maintain the security of their Azure SQL databases.
