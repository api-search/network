  Microsoft Azure MixedRealityStsClient is a client library that enables
  developers to authenticate users and acquire access tokens for Azure services,
  such as Azure Mixed Reality. By integrating this client library into their
  applications, developers can easily manage user authentication and
  authorization, allowing users to securely access resources and data within
  their Mixed Reality applications. This library simplifies the process of
  handling user identity and access control, making it easier for developers to
  focus on building immersive and engaging Mixed Reality experiences without
  having to worry about the complexities of authentication and authorization
  protocols.
