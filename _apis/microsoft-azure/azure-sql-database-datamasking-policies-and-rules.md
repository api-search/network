  Microsoft Azure SQL Database Data Masking Policies and Rules is a feature that
  allows users to define and enforce data masking rules on sensitive data stored
  in Azure SQL databases. With this feature, users can easily specify which
  columns or fields in their database contain sensitive information, such as
  social security numbers or credit card numbers, and set up rules to
  dynamically mask this data to protect it from unauthorized access. This helps
  organizations comply with data privacy regulations by ensuring that only
  authorized users have access to the original, unmasked data while all other
  users see masked or obfuscated values. Additionally, data masking policies can
  be applied at the database level or at the individual user level, providing
  flexibility in how data is protected within the Azure SQL Database
  environment.
