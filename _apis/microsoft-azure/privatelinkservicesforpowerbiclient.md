  Microsoft Azure Private Link Services for Power BI Client allows organizations
  to securely access Power BI services from within their Azure Virtual Network
  (VNet) using private endpoints. This means that all data traffic between the
  organization's virtual network and Power BI services is securely routed
  through the Azure backbone network, ensuring data privacy and compliance. By
  leveraging Private Link Services, organizations can restrict access to Power
  BI services to select users within their VNet, reducing the risk of
  unauthorized access. Additionally, this solution helps to improve network
  performance and reliability by eliminating the need to connect to Power BI
  services over the public internet. Overall, Microsoft Azure Private Link
  Services for Power BI Client provides a secure and efficient way for
  organizations to access Power BI services within their Azure environment.
