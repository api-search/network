  Microsoft Azure Maps Web Feature Service provides a set of APIs that allow
  users to access and manipulate geospatial data on the Azure cloud platform.
  With this service, users can store, search, and retrieve spatial data such as
  points of interest, roads, and polygons. The service supports various spatial
  data formats and enables users to perform spatial queries and spatial
  analytics. Users can also visualize their geospatial data on interactive maps
  and integrate it with their applications to create location-based services.
  Azure Maps Web Feature Service is designed to help developers build innovative
  and dynamic geospatial applications that leverage the power of the cloud.
