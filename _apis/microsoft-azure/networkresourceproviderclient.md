  The Microsoft Azure Network Resource Provider Client is a tool that allows
  users to efficiently manage and configure network resources within the Azure
  cloud platform. With this client, users can easily create and manage virtual
  networks, subnets, load balancers, and virtual private networks. The client
  also enables users to monitor network performance, set up security rules, and
  establish connectivity between on-premises networks and Azure resources. By
  providing a centralized interface for network management tasks, the Azure
  Network Resource Provider Client helps streamline the process of setting up
  and managing network infrastructure in the cloud.
