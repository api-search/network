  The Microsoft Azure Purview Policy Client is a tool that enables organizations
  to define and enforce data governance policies within their Azure environment.
  This client allows users to create and manage policies that govern who can
  access and manipulate data, as well as how that data is classified, protected,
  and utilized. With the Azure Purview Policy Client, organizations can
  establish consistent and compliant data governance practices, enabling them to
  better manage and secure their data assets while ensuring regulatory
  compliance and data privacy. This client provides a centralized platform for
  managing data governance policies across multiple Azure services, simplifying
  the process of maintaining data compliance and security.
