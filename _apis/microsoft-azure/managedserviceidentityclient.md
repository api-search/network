  The Microsoft Azure Managed Service Identity Client is a tool designed to
  simplify the process of managing identities and access control for Azure
  resources. This client enables developers to securely access Azure services
  without the need to store credentials in their code or manage them manually.
  By leveraging managed identities, developers can easily authenticate and
  authorize their applications to interact with various Azure services, such as
  Azure Key Vault, Azure Storage, and Azure SQL Database. This not only improves
  the overall security of the application but also streamlines the development
  process by eliminating the need for managing credentials and tokens. Overall,
  the Microsoft Azure Managed Service Identity Client helps developers focus on
  building their applications while ensuring secure access to Azure resources.
