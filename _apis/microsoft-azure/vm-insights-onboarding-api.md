  The Microsoft Azure VM Insights Onboarding API is a tool that allows users to
  easily onboard their virtual machines (VMs) on Azure for monitoring and
  optimization purposes. By leveraging this API, users can automate the process
  of setting up performance monitoring and analytics for their VMs, enabling
  them to gain valuable insights into the health, performance, and usage of
  their virtual machines. This API streamlines the onboarding process, making it
  faster and more efficient for users to start monitoring and optimizing their
  VMs on Azure, ultimately helping them to maximize the efficiency and
  reliability of their cloud infrastructure.
