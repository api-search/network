  The Microsoft Azure Action Groups API is a platform that allows users to
  define a set of notifications and actions that are triggered in response to
  specific events or alerts within the Azure ecosystem. Users can create custom
  action groups and specify the notifications and actions that should be taken
  when certain conditions are met. These actions can range from sending emails
  or text messages to executing automated scripts or escalating issues to
  designated individuals. By leveraging the Action Groups API, Azure users can
  streamline their response processes and ensure that critical events are
  addressed promptly and efficiently.
