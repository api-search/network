description: >-
  Microsoft Azure Service Fabric Client APIs provide developers with a way to
  interact with and manage service instances deployed in a Service Fabric
  cluster. These APIs allow developers to perform various operations such as
  creating, deploying, and upgrading services, as well as monitoring the health
  and status of services within the cluster. By using these APIs, developers can
  easily build scalable and reliable microservices-based applications that can
  be deployed and managed efficiently in the cloud. Additionally, the Service
  Fabric Client APIs support integration with other Azure services, enabling
  developers to create seamless and comprehensive solutions for their
  applications.
