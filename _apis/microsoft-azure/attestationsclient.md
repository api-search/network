  Microsoft Azure Attestations Client is a service that enables developers to
  prove the integrity and security of their applications running on Azure. It
  allows users to verify the trustworthiness of the components and prevent
  unauthorized modifications. By generating cryptographic evidence of the state
  of the application at a specific point in time, developers can ensure that
  their code has not been tampered with and is running as intended. Azure
  Attestations Client provides a secure and reliable way to validate the
  integrity of applications and protect against potential security threats.
