  A Microsoft Azure Subscription Client is a user or organization that has
  purchased a subscription to Microsoft Azure, a cloud computing platform that
  offers a wide range of services and resources for building, deploying, and
  managing applications and services through Microsoft's global network of data
  centers. The Subscription Client has access to a variety of tools and
  resources to help them optimize their use of Azure services, such as
  monitoring and analytics, security and compliance features, and cost
  management tools. They can manage and scale their resources, deploy new
  applications, and integrate with other Azure services to meet their unique
  business needs. The Subscription Client also has access to Microsoft's support
  and training resources to help them make the most of their Azure subscription.
