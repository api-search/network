  The Microsoft Azure Monitor Workspaces Control Plane API is a tool that
  provides control and management capabilities for monitoring workspaces
  deployed within the Azure cloud environment. This API allows users to create,
  manage, and delete monitoring workspaces, as well as configure and customize
  monitoring settings. It also provides access to diagnostic data and metrics
  collected from various resources within the workspace, allowing users to track
  and analyze the performance of their applications and services. By using the
  Control Plane API, users can gain valuable insights into the health and
  performance of their Azure resources, helping them to optimize their
  operations and improve overall efficiency.
