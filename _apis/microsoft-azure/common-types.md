  Microsoft Azure Common Types is a collection of frequently used data types and
  classes that are used in various Microsoft Azure services and products. These
  common types help developers to easily and efficiently work with Azure
  resources and services by providing a standardized way to represent and
  interact with data. Some of the common types include data structures like
  lists, dictionaries, and arrays, as well as classes for managing Azure
  resources such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and databases. By
  providing these common types, Microsoft Azure simplifies the development
  process for creating and managing applications in the cloud.
