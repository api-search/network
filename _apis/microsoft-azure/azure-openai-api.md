  Microsoft Azure Open AI API is a suite of tools and services that enable
  developers to integrate artificial intelligence capabilities into their
  applications. This API allows users to access pre-trained machine learning
  models for tasks such as natural language processing, image recognition, and
  text generation. With Azure Open AI API, developers can easily incorporate
  advanced AI functionality into their software without having to build and
  train their own models from scratch. This simplifies the process of developing
  AI-powered applications and allows developers to focus on creating innovative
  solutions that leverage the power of artificial intelligence.
