  The Microsoft Azure Policy Events Client is a tool that allows users to
  monitor and manage policy events within their Azure environment. With this
  client, users can track policy evaluations, exemptions, and other
  policy-related activities to ensure compliance with organizational standards
  and regulations. By using this tool, administrators can gain insight into
  which resources are not meeting policy requirements and take corrective
  actions to bring them into compliance. Additionally, the Azure Policy Events
  Client provides a centralized dashboard where users can view and analyze
  policy event data, making it easier to identify trends, troubleshoot issues,
  and optimize policy configurations for improved security and governance.
