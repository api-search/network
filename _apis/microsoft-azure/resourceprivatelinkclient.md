description: >-
  Microsoft Azure Resource Private Link Client is a service that helps to
  securely connect and access private resources within Azure. It allows users to
  create private endpoints to access Azure services such as storage accounts,
  databases, and other resources without exposing them to the public internet.
  By using Private Link Client, users can ensure that their data remains secure
  and confidential by restricting access only to authorized users and
  applications. This service is especially useful for organizations that handle
  sensitive information and need to maintain strict control over who can access
  their resources. Additionally, Private Link Client helps to streamline network
  connectivity and simplify the management of permissions and access control
  policies.
