description: >-
  Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL is a globally distributed,
  multi-model database service that allows users to store and manage data at a
  massive scale across geographic regions. It provides high availability and low
  latency for read and write operations, ensuring consistent performance for
  applications that require real-time data access. With Cosmos DB, users can
  easily scale their database resources based on demand, making it a
  cost-effective solution for applications with unpredictable workloads.
  Additionally, Cosmos DB offers built-in support for indexing, querying, and
  data replication, ensuring that data is always available and secure.
