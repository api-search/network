  Microsoft Azure ScopeConnections is a feature that allows users to control the
  scope of connections within their Azure environment. With ScopeConnections,
  users can define specific connections and the boundaries within which those
  connections can operate. This capability enhances security by restricting
  access to resources and services only to authorized parties, while also
  streamlining network management and optimizing performance. By utilizing
  ScopeConnections, users can ensure that their Azure resources are accessed and
  utilized in a secure and efficient manner, ultimately leading to a more robust
  and reliable cloud computing environment.
