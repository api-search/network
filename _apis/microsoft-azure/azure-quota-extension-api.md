  The Microsoft Azure Quota Extension API allows users to programmatically
  manage and extend their resource quotas in the Azure cloud platform. With this
  API, developers can request additional resources or adjust existing quotas for
  services such as virtual machines, storage, or networking. By leveraging this
  API, organizations can easily scale their infrastructure to meet growing
  demands and ensure that they have sufficient resources to support their
  applications and workloads. This flexibility and control provided by the Quota
  Extension API enable businesses to optimize their resource utilization and
  achieve greater efficiency in their Azure deployments.
