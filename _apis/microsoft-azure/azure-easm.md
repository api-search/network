  EASM discovers and maps your digital attack surface to provide an "outside-in"
  perspective using probes to discover assets. The assets are provided with
  detailed metadata associated, including vulnerabilities, configurations and
  web components, allowing customers to view and prioritize external risk. The
  EASM REST API enables you to develop clients that integrate with your
  application.
