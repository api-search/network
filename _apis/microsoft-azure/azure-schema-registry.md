  Microsoft Azure Schema Registry is a centralized repository that allows users
  to store and manage the schemas for their data in one place. It provides a
  platform for organizations to standardize their data structures and ensure
  consistency across all applications and services. By centralizing schemas,
  Azure Schema Registry helps to simplify data integration and governance
  processes, making it easier for teams to collaborate and share data.
  Additionally, Azure Schema Registry supports compatibility checks for schema
  evolution, ensuring that changes made to schemas do not break existing data
  pipelines. Ultimately, Azure Schema Registry helps organizations streamline
  their data management processes and improve the efficiency and reliability of
  their data workflows.
