  Azure Purview Data Map is a data governance solution that helps organizations
  discover, classify, and manage all their data assets across on-premises,
  multicloud, and SaaS environments. The Data Map allows users to create a
  holistic view of their data landscape, including structured and unstructured
  data, so they can understand where their data resides, who has access to it,
  and how it is being used. By providing a centralized data catalog and lineage
  tracking, Azure Purview Data Map helps organizations enhance data quality,
  ensure compliance with regulations, and drive better decision-making through
  deeper insights into their data ecosystems.
