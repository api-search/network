description: >-
  This API is used for the classic integration. If you are just starting your
  implementation, refer to our [new integration
  guide](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms) instead.\n\nThe
  Notification Configuration API provides endpoints for setting up and testing
  notifications that inform you of events on your platform, for example when a
  verification check or a payout has been completed.\n\nFor more information,
  refer to our
  [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/classic/notifications).
