description: >-
  This API is used for the classic integration. If you are just starting your
  implementation, refer to our new integration guide instead. The Account API
  provides endpoints for managing account-related entities on your platform.
  These related entities include account holders, accounts, bank accounts,
  shareholders, and verification-related documents. The management operations
  include actions such as creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of them.
