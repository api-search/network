description: >-
  Conductor allows you to build a complex application using simple and granular
  tasks that do not need to be aware of or keep track of the state of your
  application's execution flow. Conductor keeps track of the state, calls tasks
  in the right order (sequentially or in parallel, as defined by you), retry
  calls if needed, handle failure scenarios gracefully, and outputs the final
  result.
