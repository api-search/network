  The Checkpoint Identity Awareness API enables organizations to easily
  integrate identity and user information into their security infrastructure.
  This API allows for the seamless identification of users and devices accessing
  network resources, providing a more granular and efficient control over
  network traffic. By leveraging identity data, organizations can enforce
  security policies based on user roles, locations, and devices, improving
  overall threat detection and response capabilities. With Checkpoint Identity
  Awareness API, organizations can gain a comprehensive view of network
  activity, monitor user behavior, and quickly respond to potential security
  incidents.
