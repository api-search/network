  Webhooks v3 sends you near real-time notifications any time a user account is
  created, deleted, or modified. Sometimes these notifications are invaluable in
  safeguarding your website. For example, a sudden and unexpected flurry of
  password changes could indicate that your security has been breached and a
  malefactor is busy changing all your user passwords.
