  This API provides various HTTP methods you can use to manage your NetStorage
  content. Communication uses the Edge network using a HTTP(S) client of your
  own design. The client could be a web-based browser or scripted tools
  integrated with your content management system so long as each request
  provides the required HTTP headers.
