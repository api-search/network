  This API allows an LCDN operator to configure the AMC to communicate with an
  external secret store for storing TLS secrets. The API supports only secret
  stores based on Hashicorp-Vault. Hashicorp-Vault is an open source secret
  management solution that secures, stores, and controls access to tokens,
  passwords, certificates, API keys and other secrets. For more information
  about Hashicorp-Vault, see the Hashicorp site.
