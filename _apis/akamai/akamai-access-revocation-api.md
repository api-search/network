description: >-
  Adaptive Media Delivery supports Token Authentication. You can apply it to
  generate unique tokens and include them in requests for your content. Akamai
  validates these tokens to grant access to your media. Access Revocation lets
  you recognize tokens that have been hijacked and flag them to block requests
  that include them. Use the Access Revocation API to generate a revocation list
  of these tokens. You can also set a time to live for this revocation period to
  automatically unrevoke these tokens, or you can manually remove them from a
  revocation list. The API also lets you review your revocation lists and Access
  Revocation settings.
