  Enterprise Application Access allows you to integrate data path protection,
  single sign-on, identity access, application security, and management
  visibility and control for enterprise applications. EAA delivers access to
  applications, not the entire network. With EAA, users dont access applications
  directlyinstead, apps are hidden from the Internet and public exposure by
  closing all inbound firewall ports while providing authenticated end-users
  with access to only their own special applications.
