description: >-
  The Site Shield API offers a programmatic interface that provides an
  additional layer of defense for your critical websites and web applications.
  This API removes websites and applications from internet-accessible IP address
  space and prevents attackers from directly accessing the origin. Instead,
  clients must go through the Akamai Intelligent Platform, where attacks are
  detected and mitigated.
