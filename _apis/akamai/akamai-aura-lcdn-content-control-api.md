  This API allows the LCDN Operator or Content Provider to purge content on the
  Aura LCDN. Purging removes outdated or unwanted content. Content can be purged
  one asset at a time, as a list of assets, or all assetswithin a directory
  using a wildcard. After an asset is purged, the first subsequent client
  request for the purged content results in a cache miss, and LCDN fetches a
  fresh copy from the origin server.
