  Identity Cloud uses its own terminology when referring to user accounts and to
  the databases where user account information is stored. In Identity Cloud, the
  term entity is used when referencing user accounts and user profiles. As you
  might expect then, the /entity.create operation is used to create user
  accounts and the /entity.find operation is used to search for user accounts.
