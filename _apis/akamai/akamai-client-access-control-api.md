  The Client Access Control (CAC) API helps you manage access between your web
  assets and the edge servers on the Akamai network. With this API you can
  retrieve information about the CIDR blocks that currently connect your content
  to the Akamai network. In addition, when Akamai updates the CIDR blocks used
  for access, this API allows you to review the changes and send an
  acknowledgement to Akamai once you update your Access Control List (ACL).
