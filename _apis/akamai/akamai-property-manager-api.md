  The Property Manager API (PAPI) offers a programmatic interface to manage how
  Akamai edge servers process requests, responses, and objects served over the
  Akamai platform. A distributed property configuration collects all the rules
  for how to process end-user requests for your web assets. Like Property
  Manager in Akamai Control Center, this API lets you modify your property
  configurations and activate them on Akamai staging or production networks. The
  API allows you to access the same features rapidly and flexibly using your own
  tools. With PAPI, you can generate properties, associate them with dynamically
  generated hostnames, and create new CP codes to report on your contents
  traffic. PAPI also provides bulk update capabilities for modifying and
  activating many properties at once, and includes that let you split huge
  property configurations into smaller, reusable chunks.
