  Resolving issues with your website and applications after a property is pushed
  to the content delivery network is inefficient and a drain on resources. With
  Sandbox, you can tweak your site delivery options and test in an isolated
  development environment to identify issues locally before merging.Incorporate
  the Sandbox API into your agile development workflow to improve efficiency and
  identify potential issues well in advance of deployment. You can quickly test
  and validate code changes on your local development server through a secure
  connection to your sandbox.
