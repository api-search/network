  The Alerts API allows you to configure notifications about significant changes
  to your traffic based on continual tracking by Akamais network monitoring
  platform. It allows you to create and modify alerts based on a wide range of
  criteria, both static and dynamic, and to configure reports on anomalies. This
  API provides you with a programmatic interface to the same functionality
  available in Akamai Control Center.
