description: >-
  The Enhanced Content Control Utility (ECCU) is one of several supported Akamai
  purge interfaces. Use ECCU to specify the set of files to refresh on the edge
  network. Specify directories, file extensions, certain types of HTTP request,
  or response properties to refine the set of content to refresh. For example,
  you can refresh specific parts of a library or the complete cache repository
  for many domains. The ECCU only invalidates content. It doesnt remove content
  from cache.
