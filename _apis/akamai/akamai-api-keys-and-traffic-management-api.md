  Like API Keys and Traffic Management in Akamai Control Center, this API lets
  you create and manage API keys that serve as unique identifiers for API
  consumers. API keys exist inside top-level units called key collections. At
  the key collection level, you can set a quota limit for the number of
  successful requests that individual API clients can make. You can also edit
  access control lists (ACLs) associated with your API endpoints and resources.
  Together with the API Endpoint Definition API, you can use this API to
  programmatically deploy your APIs on the Akamai network.
