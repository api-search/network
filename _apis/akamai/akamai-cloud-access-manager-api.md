description: >-
  The Cloud Access Manager (CAM) API connects the Akamai Intelligent Platform
  and your cloud provider. Use CAM to enable cloud origin authentication and
  securely store and manage your cloud provider origin credentials as access
  keys. You can easily select an access key in the Origin Characteristics
  behavior when creating a Property Manager property for your Akamai product,
  eliminating the need to manually provide the credentials. You can use the same
  access key between several properties, for Akamai products that offer support
  for the Origin Characteristics behavior.
