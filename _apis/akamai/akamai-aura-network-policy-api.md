  This API allows the Aura Licensed CDN (LCDN) operator to programmatically
  block IP addresses associated with a specified IP CIDR block from accessing
  nodes on the LCDN for a pre-defined period of time. After the time expires,
  the IP addresses associated with the IP CIDR block will be unblocked.
