  The Internet domain name system (DNS) is a distributed system. It allows
  computer programs to issue queries about domain names which the DNS returns
  one or more answers to. The most common use for DNS is to convert hostnames,
  such as www.example.com, into IP addresses, which identify a particular
  computer at a particular Internet location. In the most traditional usage, a
  querys answers are static. Someone types the answers into a configuration
  file, and the answers change only when the file changes.
