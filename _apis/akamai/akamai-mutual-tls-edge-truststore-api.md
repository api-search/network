  You can use Mutual TLS Edge Truststore API to create, manage, and activate
  certificate (CA) sets needed to set up mutual authentication (mTLS) sessions
  between a client and Akamai edge servers.Each CA set contains a collection of
  certificates that validate the client certificates presented by a user during
  mTLS  thats the TLS handshake at the edge server.
