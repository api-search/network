  The Hosted Login, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect APIs represent your primary
  toolset for managing Hosted Login. Most Hosted Login management tasks can only
  be carried out by using API calls. Keep in mind, too that some Hosted Login
  management tasks, such as managing two-factor authentication messages, or
  creating, modifying, and deleting Hosted Login links, require the use of other
  operations. For example, you need to use the Configuration API to manage
  two-factor authentication messages or Hosted Login Links.
