description: >-
  The Token Access Control API allows you to programmatically create, manage,
  and store collections of public keys. It lets you upload public keys into key
  collections, activate key collections in the staging environment before going
  live, and create key collection versions to enable frictionless public key
  rotation for property configurations.
