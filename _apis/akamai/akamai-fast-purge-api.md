  The Fast Purge API provides a programmatic interface for you to purge edge
  content. In this version, purge your own set of URLs or ARLs (Akamai resource
  locators), or any content grouped under a content provider (CP) code or cache
  tag. Delivery products such as Ion, Adaptive Media Delivery, Dynamic Delivery,
  and Dynamic Site Accelerator all support Fast Purge. If youre using a legacy
  Content Control Utility (CCU) API to purge content, see the migration
  instructions to convert your API programs to use Fast Purge.
