  The Carbon Calculator API enables issuers to provide their consumers with
  visibility into the environmental impact based on their spending. This API
  allows the issuer to calculate the carbon footprint based on consumers'
  payment transactions using their Mastercard cards. This API can be used inside
  a banking application or website to provide meaningful and actionable
  insights.
