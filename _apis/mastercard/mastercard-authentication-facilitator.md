      The Authentication Facilitator API is a building block of the Mastercard
      Authentication Service that enables MDES token requestors to authenticate
      cardholders leveraging cardholder information maintained by card issuers.
      The Token Requestor determines when cardholder authentication has to take
      place for its own program. The Token Requestor is also responsible for
      specifying and implementing the actions required by the business logic
      resulting from the authentication code validation information returned by
      the Authentication Service.
