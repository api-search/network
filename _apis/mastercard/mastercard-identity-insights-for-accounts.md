description: >-
  Today's digital economy has transformed consumer behaviors and expectations.
  As more interactions are conducted virtually, consumers have come to expect
  every company to have a smooth, easy digital onboarding process. For financial
  institutions especially, the balance between consumer friction and fraud
  detection is even more acute when assessing thin-file or unbanked consumers.
  Risk-averse banks often treat applications as fraudulent until proven
  otherwise to protect against growing identity fraud, leading to poor user
  experiences that may drive good consumers to competitors.
