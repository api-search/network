description: "Straight Through Processing (STP) is a value-added service designed to increase virtual card account acceptance by Suppliers. With Mastercard STP, Suppliers no longer need to manually enter each card account number into their point of sale to accept payment. The Acquirer automatically generates an authorization request on behalf of the Supplier and delivers the funds for approved transactions to the Supplier\x19s bank account."
