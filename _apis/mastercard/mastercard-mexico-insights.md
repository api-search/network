  The regulations set by the Central Bank of Mexico requiring payment system
  operators like Mastercard to expose transaction data volumes will have
  significant implications for the payments industry in Mexico. This move aims
  to promote transparency and enable other clearinghouse entities, such as
  EGLOBAL, VISA, PROSA, the Mexico Central Bank, issuers, acquirers, and the
  public, to access and analyze transaction data.
