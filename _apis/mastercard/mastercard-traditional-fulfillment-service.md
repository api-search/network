  The Traditional Fulfillment Service delivers a seamless and secure way to
  enable a redemption experience. A rewards program allows for the retrieval of
  catalogs or items based on search criteria. The fulfillment items (such as
  gift cards) are displayed on a consumer-facing website or used to document
  details in a customer-servicing application.
