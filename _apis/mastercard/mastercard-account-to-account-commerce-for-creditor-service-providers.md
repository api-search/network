  Online checkouts can be frustrating and tedious. As shopping habits shift to
  digital, consumers and merchants require secure and streamlined online
  experiences. Mastercard Account to Account Commerce enables creditor service
  providers (CSP) to provide their creditors (merchants) and debtors (consumers)
  with an intuitive checkout experience that will improve the overall online
  payments experience, reduce friction at checkout, and improve customer
  conversions. Through Account to Account Commerce, creditors can initiate
  payment requests, offer refunds, and offer account-on-file services to debtors
  of participating debtor service providers.
