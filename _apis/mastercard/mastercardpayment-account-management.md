  Mastercard issuers can use the Payment Acount Management (PAM) API to
  uniformly perform account lifecycle management on accounts held across
  different Mastercard systems. The PAM API can be used to submit lifecycle
  management events that update associated Mastercard Digital Enablement Service
  (MDES) tokens. Automatic Billing Updater (ABU)-implemented issuers can also
  use PAM API to submit real-time account updates that the ABU system consumes
  in near real-time.
