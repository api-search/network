  The Mastercard Alert To Control High-risk Merchants (MATCH Pro) system allows
  an Authorized User to assess potential risks associated with a Merchant prior
  to enabling Mastercard acceptance, with the opportunity to develop and review
  enhanced or incremental risk information before entering into a Merchant
  agreement. MATCH Pro is a mandatory system for Mastercard Acquirers, unless
  exempted by Mastercard, or prohibited by law. The MATCH Pro database includes
  customer-reported information about MATCH Merchants (and their owners) that an
  Authorized user has terminated. When an Acquirer considers onboarding a MATCH
  Merchant, MATCH Pro can assist Acquirers with risk determinations during
  onboarding. By making independent risk determinations, Acquirers are able to
  add MATCH Merchants who have been added to MATCH PRO.
