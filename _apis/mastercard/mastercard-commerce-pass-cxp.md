  Commerce Pass is an offline stored value account (SVA) that enables consumers
  and MSMEs to store, receive, and spend funds digitally making transactions
  secure and transparent. This enables both merchants and consumers to build a
  financial persona, made up of a digital identity and transaction history,
  allowing banks the ability to offer credit and other suitable financial
  products to previously excluded communities.
