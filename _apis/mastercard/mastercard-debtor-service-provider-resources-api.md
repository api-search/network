  digital, consumers and merchants require secure and streamlined online
  experiences. Mastercard Account to Account Commerce enables debtor service
  providers (DSP) to provide their debtors (customers) with a fast, secure, and
  convenient way to pay using their mobile banking app.= Through Account to
  Account Commerce, the debtors can view their balance before checkout, initiate
  refunds, and use their accounts for recurring payments or frequent purchases.
