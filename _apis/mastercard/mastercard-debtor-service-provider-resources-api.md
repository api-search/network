  Online checkouts can be frustrating and tedious. As shopping habits shift to
  digital, consumers and merchants require secure and streamlined online
  experiences. Mastercard Account to Account Commerce enables debtor service
  providers (DSP) to provide their debtors (customers) with a fast, secure, and
  convenient way to pay using their mobile banking app.= Through Account to
  Account Commerce, the debtors can view their balance before checkout, initiate
  refunds, and use their accounts for recurring payments or frequent purchases.
