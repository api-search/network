  The Benefit Allocation Service (BAS) allows issuers to efficiently manage
  cardholder value propositions in real-time. It enables the assignment and
  replacement of benefits, the freezing and unfreezing of cards, and the
  complete replacement of cards. Historically, benefits were assigned using a
  one-size-fits-all approach, limited by batch processing, which delayed
  critical changes and fragmented card management. BAS revolutionizes this
  process by offering instant, automated solutions on a single platform,
  enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. Its flexibility
  and responsiveness ensure issuers can meet the dynamic needs of their
  cardholders.
