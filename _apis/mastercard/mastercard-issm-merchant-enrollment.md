  The Merchant Enrollment API enables acquirers and their service providers to
  manage merchant participation in Mastercard Identity Check on EMV 3DS (3DS2).
  Acquirers and service providers can add/delete merchants directly in
  Mastercard Identity Solutions Services Management (ISSM) by sending the
  enrollment data through API interfaces.
