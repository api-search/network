  Mastercard_ Merchant Presented QR (MPQR) is a Mastercard QR program providing
  a consumer-initiated, mobile payment solution. MPQR enables consumers to make
  cashless payments for goods and services from their mobile phones by simply
  scanning a Mastercard QR Code or manually inputting an alias provided by any
  Mastercard QR accepting merchant. This push payment method has the convenience
  of cash and the security of a card payment, without needing a card payment
  terminal.
