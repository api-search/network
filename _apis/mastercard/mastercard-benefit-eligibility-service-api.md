  This API is for third-parties who want to enable eligibility checks based on
  input criteria including card number. The Eligibility API is a PAN (Primary
  Account Number) level verification service designed to promote targeted
  distribution of Mastercard card level benefits. This service enables merchants
  and third-party developers to use a PAN to check the eligibility and access
  rights to the benefits for those cardholders.
