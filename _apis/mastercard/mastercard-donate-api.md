  The Mastercard Donate Service provides a seamless and safe way for partners to
  enable cardholders to incorporate giving into their daily activities.
  Cardholders can make a one-time donation, a monthly donations, or donate a few
  cents for every transaction they make. A small gesture, like paying for
  groceries or a bus, becomes something bigger.
