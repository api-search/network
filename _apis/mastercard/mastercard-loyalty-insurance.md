  This service provides banks and customers with a digital solution that makes
  it easier to manage claims globally within their web apps rather than visiting
  multiple insurance sites. This facilitates claims submissions by gathering all
  details via issuer app before redirecting cardholder to claims processing
  website for pre-selecting benefit and pre-filling forms. This also provides
  capability to search claim status within banking app.
