description: >-
  This API is a direct feed to our IP blocklist data. You can download the IP
  data in either Berkeley DB (BDB) or CSV format. The berkeley DB data can be
  imported into berkeley DB using the db_load command or programmatically. The
  CSV format has 2 columns, the first column is the IP address and the second
  column contains the blocklist names. Blocklists are updated each day at 0600
  UTC.
