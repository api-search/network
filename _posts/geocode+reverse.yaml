name: Geocode Reverse
description: >-
  Reverse geocoding is the process of taking a coordinate (latitude and
  longitude) and mapping this to a real world address or location. This API is
  ideal for applications which process location data (for example mobile GPS)
  and need to correlate this with real locations or addresses. If your
  coordinates do not map directly to a physical address then you may only get
  city and country data back.
