  Get location information about an IP address. Depending on the specific IP
  address you can determine the country, region, city, longitude and latitude of
  the address. Our high quality database for geolocation data is being
  constantly updated as the internet address allocation changes (the database is
  usually updated at least once per month). This API can also be used to do
  reverse DNS (PTR) lookups.
