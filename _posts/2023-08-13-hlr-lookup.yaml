description: >-
  The home location register (HLR) is a central database that contains details
  of each mobile phone subscriber connected to the global mobile network. You
  can use this API to validate that a mobile number is actually live and
  registered on a mobile network (in real-time). This API will also inform you
  if a mobile number has been ported from one carrier to another and will also
  supply other detailed information about the number.
