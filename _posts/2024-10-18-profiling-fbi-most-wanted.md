[I recently profiled the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Most Wanted API](https://github.com/api-search/federal-bureau-of-investigation/blob/main/apis.yml). There are [additional APIs to be profiled](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/api), but I wanted to get this one in the system so we could use as part of other work.

One thing I tested with this one was the ability for ChatGPT to generate an OpenAPI if I pasted specific content from the [Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Most Wanted API page](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/api). It did a really good job producing the [OpenAPI](https://github.com/api-search/federal-bureau-of-investigation/blob/main/openapi.yml) in the repo and is something I will continue to use and automate around.

You can visit [the APIs.yml and OpenAPI over at the GitHub repository for Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Most Wanted API](https://github.com/api-search/federal-bureau-of-investigation/blob/main/apis.yml), and we will keep adding other APIs and common properties for Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Most Wanted API as time allows.
