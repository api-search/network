[I recently profiled the Moody's KYC API](https://github.com/api-search/moodys/blob/main/apis.yml), which was an acquisition they made of Kompany.com. I was able to find the documentation and an OpenAPI, which I added as API properties. 

I profiled many common properties including plans, getting started, news, guides, and sandbox. I like that they had use cases, and had an interesting one called connections, which I still need to figure out what it does.

I will visit their main developer portal now and see where this acquisition fits in with the bigger picture. This acquisition discovery provides a good doorway to the rest of the APIs they offer.

You can visit [the APIs.yml over at the GitHub repository for Moody's KYC entity verification, screening, and risk](https://github.com/api-search/moodys/blob/main/apis.yml), and once I sign-up I will see if we can get more details about the OpenAPI, and other resources to further flesh out the profile for Moody's.
