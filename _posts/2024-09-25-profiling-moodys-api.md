APIs play a vital role in modern tech ecosystems, enabling developers to access various services and integrate them seamlessly into their applications. In this post, we'll walk through the process of profiling Moody's API using the APIs.json format, a powerful discovery tool for APIs. We’ll cover how to create a public repository for the API profile, gather relevant links, and set up a basic framework for further development.

## Step 1: Introduction to Moody's API
Moody's, a global risk assessment firm, provides a portfolio of solutions in compliance and third-party risk management. As part of the profiling process, we’ll explore Moody's API offerings, which include services like entity verification, screening platforms, and other risk management tools.

The goal here is to profile the API using the APIs.json format, a structured format that allows for easy discovery of APIs and their associated resources.

## Step 2: Understanding APIs.json
APIs.json is a lightweight format designed to help people discover APIs. It’s similar to a sitemap for APIs, providing a structured way to describe where the API documentation, resources, and developer portals are located.

For this walk-through, we start by creating an APIs.yaml file (an easier-to-edit format) using an example from apis.io. This will serve as the foundation for building out the profile for Moody's API.

## Step 3: Setting Up the Repository
Next, we set up a public repository named Moody's (without the apostrophe, for compatibility reasons) to host our APIs.json file. Here’s how to do it:

- Create the repository: Add a README file to describe the project briefly.
- Create a new file: This file will hold our APIs.yaml data. Once created, we commit it to the repository.

At this point, we’re ready to gather all the relevant information from Moody’s website and integrate it into our profile.

## Step 4: Gathering Links and Resources
With the repository set up, it’s time to gather the URLs that correspond to Moody's API resources. By exploring the developer portal and API documentation, we can collect links to critical components:

- KYC API: Provides Know Your Customer (KYC) features.
- Plans page: Shows different subscription plans.
- Getting Started Guide: Helps developers onboard quickly.
- Console: Allows developers to interact with the API (though access may be restricted).
- Community site: A resource for developers to engage with the Moody’s developer ecosystem.
- Sandbox: A testing environment, though restricted.
- Use cases: Examples that demonstrate the API’s capabilities.
- References and Resources: Additional documentation, endpoints, and tools like the OpenAPI definition.

Some of these resources may not be immediately accessible without signing up for the service. However, we collect all the available links for now, noting where further access is required.

## Step 5: Organizing the APIs.yaml File
With our links collected, we now add them to the APIs.yaml file, organizing them under common properties such as:

- Portal: The main entry point for developers.
- Getting Started: For onboarding guides and introductory resources.
- Console: The interactive console for developers.
- News: Updates and announcements from Moody's.
- Sandbox: A testing environment for the API.
- Use Cases: Business use cases that demonstrate the API’s utility.
- Resources: Additional documentation and references.

Using YAML makes editing easy and flexible, and we structure it in a way that allows for future expansion as more APIs or resources become available.

## Step 6: Adding Descriptions and Tags
Each API profile needs a clear description and relevant tags. For Moody's API, we use descriptive tags like:

- Entity Verification
- Risk Management
- Screening Platforms

These tags help categorize the API for easier discovery in the future. We also add metadata such as the date the profile was created and modified.

## Step 7: Finalizing the APIs.json Profile
With the profile structure in place, we commit the changes. This includes:

- The APIs.yaml file with all collected links and common properties.
- Descriptions and metadata for the API.
- A placeholder for the OpenAPI definition, which can be retrieved later after signing up for access.

This initial profile provides a solid foundation for further development. Once full access to the API is obtained, we can create a Postman collection for testing and interacting with the API.

## Step 8: Next Steps
The next steps in the process include:

- Signing up for access to the full API resources.
- Retrieving the OpenAPI definition and integrating it into the profile.
- Creating a Postman collection to streamline API testing.

Submitting the completed profile as an issue for feedback or future contributions.
This initial profiling sets the stage for Moody's API to be discoverable through APIs.json, making it easier for developers to understand and use the API.

## Conclusion
Profiling an API using APIs.json is a valuable process that enables API discovery and documentation in a standardized format. By following these steps, you can create a structured and detailed profile for any API, making it easier for developers to integrate and interact with the service. As we continue with Moody’s API, the next phases will focus on deeper interaction and validation through tools like Postman.

Stay tuned for updates as we dive deeper into Moody’s API and its offerings!

By creating this profile, we ensure that Moody's API is well-documented and accessible to the developer community. For more information on APIs.json and how to get started with API profiling, visit apis.io.
