We welcome submissions to the APs.io index, using a valid APIs.json URL describing your APIs, and how consumers can use your APIs in their applications.

{% include add.html %}

If the APIs.json file is accepted, you will receive a message immediately, but then it takes time for the APIs.json to be submitted for processing and rating.
