We welcome submissions to the APs.io index, using [a URL to a valid APIs.json file](https://apisjson.org/) that describes your APIs, and how consumers can use your APIs in their applications.

{% include add.html %}

If the [APIs.json file](https://apisjson.org/) is accepted, you will receive a message immediately, but then it takes time for the APIs.json to be submitted for processing and rating.
